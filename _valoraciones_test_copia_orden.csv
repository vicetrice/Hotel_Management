The room was very cozy and her apartment is lovely and perfectly located in a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and cafes. There are two grocery stores within walking distance. It is also super close to the subway station, making it a breeze to get there from the airport and to get into city center.  Nina was  was not only very helpful and responsive, but tremendously pleasant and welcoming. When I arrived she had prepared a welcome kit with information about local attractions, maps of the city, and even a lonely planet guide. She even arranged for me to attend yoga class with her, which was fantastic! "

What really makes a difference is Nina herself, not only an extremely caring host, but also a splendid person. If at the end of your stay you leave as friends, that is a lot more than you thought you'd get from your trip to Stockholm. "
