The room was very cozy and her apartment is lovely and perfectly located in a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and cafes. There are two grocery stores within walking distance. It is also super close to the subway station, making it a breeze to get there from the airport and to get into city center.  Nina was  was not only very helpful and responsive, but tremendously pleasant and welcoming. When I arrived she had prepared a welcome kit with information about local attractions, maps of the city, and even a lonely planet guide. She even arranged for me to attend yoga class with her, which was fantastic! "

42808,90227,2010-09-04,16461,Dafne,"Nina's place is very nice, clean and very close to what's important, i.e. shops, restaurants and subway station. What really makes a difference is Nina herself, not only an extremely caring host, but also a splendid person. If at the end of your stay you leave as friends, that is a lot more than you thought you'd get from your trip to Stockholm. "
42808,101125,2010-09-20,208617,Aron,"We found both the hostess and the apartment well prepared for our visit. When we came, there was a number of  pamphlets and guidebooks ready for us. Nina was nice, friendly and helpful, which contributed to making our Stockholm experience a very pleasant one. Her place is quite close to the center of the city. We certainly recommend it for future guests to stay at."

The bed is *really* comfortable, with all amenities, such as internet. A warm welcome with fruits, water, and easy arrangements for keys. She helped me with suggestions for restaurants, and provided many tourist information as well as maps. She is very nice, respectful, and nice to talk to. I really enjoyed my short stay there! To recommend without any hesitation!"
42808,1842592,2012-07-30,2790915,Rodrigo,"I couldn't have had a better stay than Nina's.

And as I am moving to Stockholm, the first few days could be scary, but Nina made me feel like I was in my own house. Thank you very much! :)"

The apartment is very comfortable - the bedroom was spacious and light-filled and Nina was very generous in sharing the rest of her apartment with us. The location is very convenient - everything in Stockholm was comfortably walkable, the metro station is less than 5 minutes walk, and the neighborhood around the apartment is filled with great cafes, restaurants, bars, vintage stores, parks, and was a super cool place to spend some time and explore.Nina was a perfect host from the very start - very flexible about coordinating arrival and departure times, provided awesome Swedish treats for us throughout our stay, great conversation every morning, and a stack of Stockholm maps and knowledgable recommendations. Feel like we have a new friend in Stockholm after one weekend!Highly recommended!"

42808,7654714,2013-09-28,6895983,Jeff,"I could not have asked for a better place to stay or a better host.  Nina was the most engaging and helpful host ever.  She included me in a dinner with her friends who were all as sophisticated and educated as she was.  We miraculously had a lot in common and so I continue to be a huge fan of AirBnB.  As a result, I love Sweden and cannot wait to return!"

Her listing is exactly as described and was perfect for my stay, but more importantly she is a very caring and friendly person. She went above and beyond to make sure I was happy as her guest, and I was.

I hope I can return the favor someday when you visit northern California. "
42808,8547054,2013-11-04,9640726,Karin,"We had a fabulous time at Nina's place! Before coming to Stockholm she sent us instructions on how to find her place and so it wasn't a big deal at all. Right from the first minute we entered her flat we felt very welcome. Nina is a really nice, funny, straightforward and hospitable person.She is also of great help in terms of providing information and material about stockholm.

She is out-going, pleasant, extremely helpful, and genuinely invested in you having a great time in her city. The amenities were exactly what I needed, and the apartment is located within close proximity to everything. Nina even went out of her on a few occasions to help me out with itineraries and planning.

She didn't believe it and soon neither did I!The apartment is beautiful and well located, near a T stop in a nice quiet area one block from a nice thoroughfare. With only one set of stairs and an elevator! A rare treat after 4th and 5th floor walk ups.Still the reason I do Airbnb especially in foreign countries is the hosts and Nina is the best!"

The apartment is located just two or three minutes from the Odenplan T-bana subway stop which is three stops from Central Station. You can walk from her place to the old town of Gamla Stan in a short 25 minutes or easily catch the bus or T-bana from Odenplan. There are several nearby restaurants within a minute or two walk from her place.The room and apartment were very comfortable, clean, and as described in the photos. Nina provided several guidebooks and pamphlets on Stockholm and has helpfully marked her favorite spots to see and places to eat. Nina was very friendly and a pleasure to talk to. I always enjoyed our conversations and hearing her perspective on things. She made me feel very welcome and was interested in how my stay was going. She was also very helpful in allowing me to do laundry, provided me with coffee and breakfast each morning, and let me keep my bags at her place for a late check-out. I can easily recommend Nina and her apartment if you're looking for a place to stay in Stockholm!"

The bed is a twin which is really only big enough for one so be aware of that.

The room is spacious, private and has a good-sized desk, but you are very much staying in Nina's flat - her books are everywhere, as well as interesting objects all around the living room!

She also gave some recommendations of things to do in the area, can't comment on that however as I was too busy to actually check them out.What to expect: Very cosy interior, had a warm feeling that you can't get just anywhere. Didn't feel like I was staying in an AirBNB, felt like being in a home."
145320,233159940,2018-02-08,33212603,Katina,"Kim's place is perfectly located and very comfortable. She was away during my 5-day stay, but was always very responsive in answering questions and providing advice."

Her recommendations were excellent and she was always quick to respond and made sure we felt right at home. The apartment has everything you might need for your stay. It is located within walking distance to public transportation, restaurants, bars, yet somehow feels a little secluded, which is great. Would definitely recommend staying here."
145320,250191884,2018-04-04,113793451,Jesse,"What an incredibly great location with even better hospitality, could not have asked for a better place."

The private room was small, but we could use the complete apartment and often relaxed on the nice chairs in the living room. Kim's kitchen has everything you need to cook meals and we had our own space in the fridge.The location of the apartment is indeed very central. It was a perfect starting point to explore the city walking or by public transport. Restaurants, bars, and parks can be reached within a few minutes of walking distance."

145320,268908833,2018-05-26,99271530,Kali,"Kim's home is very close to Stockholm, and it was a great place for us to stay in order to quickly reach the city on foot (about 20 min). Our check-in was a bit rough as she forgot to send us the directions to her home, but I believe that we were a special case and that this does not usually happen. The beds were quite comfortable; however, it gets a bit cold at night because the windows and doors in the home are always open. Kim allows guests to use the entire house which is very nice, and her kitchen is the cutest area. Kim is also very kind and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our experience there and would recommend staying here for a short trip!"
145320,271098522,2018-05-31,96009807,Lucy,"Kim's place is in a great location with lots of fun shopping and restaurants around. The place was very cute and comfortable with a lived in but tidy vibe. We didn't meet Kim until our second day but she was very helpful in checkin and in offering tips about Stockholm! Finally, she was very accommodating in letting us stay an extra hour and a half when our other Airbnb pushed back the check in time. Great place to stay if you want to see a different side of Stockholm but still have access to the more touristy areas!"

Wij kwamen pas na middernacht aan en ze heeft gewoon op ons gewacht. Je krijgt een kamer in haar flat op de 6e verdieping. Je bent vrij om alles te gebruiken.

The apartment is clean, nice, with a good kitchen and a very comfortable bed! While Stockholm is an expensive city - both for hotels and AirB'n'B - Kim's apartment proved to be of good value. We can only recommend other people to stay at Kim's place and be greeted by her hospitality."

The room was quite basic but perfectly nice with a proper bed (very comfy!) and there is a sitting area outside with a fridge, microwave and kettle. Lidia was very kind and helpful with all sorts of maps and tourist guides for us to borrow and loads of advice. Overall I would definitely recommend this as good value for money and a great experience"

We shared a bathroom and sitting room with other guests which worked out very smoothly, no problems, and it was nice to meet and socialize with the other guests.  Lidia's home is in the perfect location to visit Stockholm, everything is VERY easily accessible.  However, the MOST wonderful part of our stay was our host, Lidia.  She was so inviting, helpful, warm, and welcoming.  When we first arrived she had us for tea/coffee and gave us an overview of the city and places to go and see and do!  She answered all our questions throughout the stay and could not have been more helpful.  In addition, my boyfriend was having sinus problems from all the plane travel and Lidia was so kind and generous to provide some medications/remedies to help him feel better.  We 100% recommend staying with Lidia, she is a genuinely sweet, knowledgeable, thoughtful, accommodating and kind woman and host.   Thank you Lidia for everything, we wish you the very best."

She gave us a map and helped us to know where everything was. Throughout our stay she was always helpful with ideas and even researched a lovely restaurant for us for brunch on Sunday!It is worth noting that Lidia has two rooms that she rents out and these rooms share the one bathroom and the living space.

From the info she provided, I could have mistaken her for her pro advice on the sights to cover in Stockholms / admission fee prices to some and even which part of the train to stand in order to alight nearer to Saluhall at Ostermalm station (it's in front).

Luckily for me, I was the only guest so I enjoyed a double room and a private toilet and shower.The apartment is perfectly clean, and Li provides all the necessary things, such as a microwave, fridge, kettle, instant coffee and milk. The apartment has all the utensils and crockery to prepare a simple meal in the microwave. The room is small but has enough space for what you need with many electrical sockets. Very comfortable bed.Li was a great host, a pleasant conversationalist if you want, but respects your privacy if you want to be alone.I really enjoyed being in Li's flat and meeting her. She also change old banknotes for new ones when she understood that the bank would only replace notes that were out of circulation only for bank account holders.Recommended with all my heart!"
164448,172833859,2017-07-22,101573043,Eileen,Li went above and beyond expectations of a host. The space is lovely. It was nice to be near restaurants but away from all the tourist. Her apartment is located right on the major transit line and next to buses.

The house is located at five to ten-minute walks from the metro stations and bus stops also. Lidia stays at the first floor, and the guests at the second floor. There were three guest teams altogether but we had no difficulty using the bathroom. We had a lot of conversation with Lidia and the other guest, a German lady, sharing cultures and experiences. The most fascinating point with Lidia was that she pinpointed some really nice tourists' attractions in Stockholm, which was quite helpful for us to visit super worthy places. We recommend Lidia's house with both our thumbs up! We will also definitely stay at her house on our next visit to Stockholm for one to two weeks. Our stay at Lidia's house was one of the best Airbnb experiences ever. Thank you for everything, Lidia. Take care.Sincerely Yours,"

Although it is a shared house, everything you have a private room that opens to a guest-only living room and bathroom on its own floor, so you can really have your privacy. The location was also great for us. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely return next time we are in Stockholm."

164448,208160717,2017-10-31,51039937,Marco,Li is a nice lady welcoming you in the beautiful city of Stockholm! She is full of advices and suggestion to drive you during the exploration. Nice play to stay!
164448,216857083,2017-12-06,105348559,Anna,"The host is very kind and friendly. The house has a good ubication, near one of the main stations of Stockholm"
164448,235572014,2018-02-17,84879393,Junfan,Li is a nice and considerate host. The communication was smooth and so was the check-in. The place is convenient for guests with several public transportation hubs are just around the corner. I enjoyed my stay in Li's apartment in Stockholm and I would definitely recommend it to others.
164448,237004788,2018-02-21,140744820,Patrick,Li's is a great host with a cozy apartment in a great location. Li gave easy to understand directions to get from the airport to her hotel and had helpful tips for travelling around Stockholm and things to see. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it for anyone who's looking for a convenient base of operations for a Stockholm trip.
164448,243550310,2018-03-16,13848227,Lea,"Li is a very attentive, generous and kind host. The room was very clean, cosy and confortable. I really recommend! Thank you for everything"
164448,251185530,2018-04-07,81403122,Di,Li is the best! She is kind and thoughtful. Make sure that I have everything I need. Help me get the best route. Nice kitchen. Everything is perfect! I spent 3days in her house. It made me feel we are family. Transportation is convenient as well. Highly recommend!!!
164448,267885931,2018-05-23,133287338,Nathan,"Li was a spectacular host. She sat down and gave us a wonderful overview of the city and the must sees. The space is large and bright, with lots of amenities. It's very close to trains, but a nice 30 min walk to Old Towne."
164448,269464566,2018-05-27,169327061,Maxine,"Li is a nice host - she was informative of the area and things to do. The common area upstairs is shared among three rooms and that area is nice place to have conversations. The location of this place is close by to the T, so getting around everywhere is fast and easy."
164448,271128480,2018-05-31,48918400,Ho Kwan,A very nice host! Wait for me and gave me a detailed overview of the city even I am late due to flight delay! One of my best traveling experience!
164448,281595748,2018-06-25,6298826,Cassidy,Li was awesome! Thanks so much for having us!
164448,286395142,2018-07-06,175926807,Diana,"Li's place is in an excellent location to be able to walk or jump on the metro to any where in the city. Li is a sweet lady and when you arrive she has a city map ready for you and will go over where to find things in the city. WiFi is strong and works well.The following reasons are why I did not give Li's place a 5.The address is to the apartment complex not her apartment so you need to has access to a phone to call her to let you in.She uses her upstairs for Airbnb. There are three bedrooms and one bath. At times the bathroom is in use so you need to plan your day accordingly to maybe having to wait to get into the bathroom.She does not give kitchen privileges though she has a small microwave and refrigerator is the small sitting room upstairs. So if you plan on eating a lot of your meals there they will all have to be microwaveable. She has no coffee pot, just instant coffee. To get water and wash dishes you need to use the bathroom sink.Her TV's are the old tube type before remote controls. The picture is very fuzzy. If relaxing with TV after a long day is something you do, you won't be able to do that here.She has no black out curtains on the windows. We were there in July and the sun hits you in the face at 3:30 am. I was lucky enough to have an eye mask that I got on the plane or there would have been no way I could have slept in that roomThere is no visible electric outlet in the bathroom so hair drying etc has to be done in your room.Li will come into your room during the day and make your bed and straighten your things, even if the door is locked. If you do not want her to come into your room you will need to let her know that when you check in."
164448,289792128,2018-07-13,13541212,Thodoris,The place is really central; very close to the Sodra station (2-3mins) and in walking distance  from the Old Town and most other places. The room was good; everything you would expect from a short-term stay. Li was very good in making check in extremely convenient and was also extremely hospitable. I definitely recommend the place.
164448,293324526,2018-07-20,4330799,Brianna,"Li was such a great host! Her place has a great location,  comfortable bed and she was so helpful!"
164448,296778795,2018-07-26,92946108,Luca,"Solveig is offering an exceptional Yoga experience. We met in a wonderful spot in Frankfurt downtown on the riverside, where there also was a  beautiful view of the Skyline.The practice itself fits to all level. I am a intermediate beginner :) and the day after I could feel the benefits of the lesson.At the end we also had a little talk together with all other participants and Solveig gave also us a very nice travel guide with her best tips for Frankfurt! Thank you Solveig! It was fun!"
164448,296779094,2018-07-26,40220570,Ines,"Great experience to try yoga or continue practicing. Solveig was very attentive not only during class but also sharing her tips about the city. The place was also very nice, by the riverside, with a beautiful view for some pics and a nearby cafe perfect for a sunset drink. Loved the experience!  What an amazing way to end the day,  enjoy a different perspective of the city and create a good memory. "
164448,296779185,2018-07-26,168744336,Jana,"I really enjoyed the whole experience, chill-out yoga with a view over the skyline and a drink in the end. Tips for interesting Frankfurt places were valuable as well. Solveig is very nice, there are no downsides about the experience."
164448,297275207,2018-07-27,55940462,Esther,"I had a really good experience with Solveig. She is a great yoga teacher but also a very nice and warm person that makes you feel comfortable throughout the class. The practice is suitable for all levels and time and location were perfect. At the end of the class, she also shared with us very useful tips about Frankfurt and nice spots while we had a drink. 100% recommendable :)"
164448,297275796,2018-07-27,16592532,Alicia,"I really enjoyed this yoga class. It was in the perfect location, I was able to see the skyline of the city and we were right next to the river. Solveig was super nice, I really enjoyed her as a yoga instructor. After the class she shared with us a travel guide of the best places to go in Frankfurt and gave us coconut water so enjoy after the class. I will definitely go back to her class. If you are visiting or new to the city I definitely recommend this class. "
164448,297278664,2018-07-27,49186290,Ida,"It was a great experience, Solveig is very competent and nice and she held the class in an appropriate level for the participants. I also appreciated that she shared her favorite spots in Frankfurt with us, very helpful for people that are new to the city!"
164448,311067308,2018-08-20,71971282,Martin,"If you decide to do a yoga session with Solveig you can expect to meet a very friendly, kind and considerate yoga teacher. I very much enjoyed the session and the subsequent drink at the very stylish bar. Here, with a view of the skyline of central Frankfurt, Solveig kindly shared her tips for what to see and do in Frankfurt when one only has so much time to spend there. Very nice combo, yoga + info on Frankfurt"
164448,315211732,2018-08-28,154757720,Isabelle,We had a great 3 days in Stockholm staying at Li's place. It is a little cluttered and the furnishings are old fashioned but everything was clean and nothing lacking. The location is perfect. Li gave us some very useful tips when we arrived.
164448,316332466,2018-08-31,211325542,Marit,"Li is een hartstikke aardige vrouw die er alles aan doet om je verblijf bij haar zo prettig mogelijk te maken. Je mag haar altijd alles vragen en daar geeft ze ook graag antwoord op. Aan het begin van ons verblijf heeft ze ons allemaal tips gegeven over wat er te zien is in Stockholm en na het horen van onze voorkeuren wist ze nog wat meer specifieke tips te geven, waardoor ons verblijf in Stockholm zeker beter is geworden! In het verblijf zelf zijn de meubels wat oud, maar er hangt wel een hele gezellige sfeer. De badkamer is erg schoon en de douche is verrassend lekker. De bedden sliepen heerlijk en ook had Li er zelf al voor gezorgd dat er genoeg stopcontacten waren. Al met al een heerlijk verblijf hier gehad en we zouden het zeker aanraden!"
164448,325538289,2018-09-20,11104454,Ronald,"Li was a wonderful host. The room was clean and comfortable. The location was great, since it was next to the metro.  Li was very keen on helping us find our way and was happy to share her knowledge of Stockholm. :)"
164448,329532947,2018-09-29,31480145,Silvia,"Li is a special host: very kind and gentle. You'll find a special room with a shared bathroom but there are no problem at all. The room is spacious for two people and the metro, pendeltag and buses are very near. You can go everywhere without any problem and you can reach the centre of the city by bus or by metro in few minutes.Li can give you some useful advices to visit better the city and she is always ready to talk and help you planning your visit. If you are searching a beautiful spot in Stockholm, you have to choose this flat."

164448,449996074,2019-05-08,256006024,Noah,"Li was a fantastic host. When we first booked, she reached out and communicated with us about directions from the airport and welcomed us to Stockholm. When we had questions, she was prompt and detailed in her responses, and when we arrived, she sat us down for 30 min with a map and museum brochures to help us refine our itinerary. She was the perfect host in terms of giving us the privacy we wanted, but always being available if we had any questions. She clearly has lots of experience hosting and providing a comfortable environment for travelers who just want a cozy space to come back to in the evenings. In addition, her home in Sodermalm is in a great location for the walking traveler. Thank you Li for providing such a welcoming and memorable experience in Stockholm - I hope to be back again in the coming years!"
164448,451788926,2019-05-12,4360192,Hannah,"A really sweet and warm host, Li left an extra special memory of Stockholm to us!

Li's tips and advice on what to see and where to eat where spot on and added to the enjoyment of our stay in Stockholm. Would highly recommend.

The receiving/living area is one of the best touches of the house forme. The neighborhood is such a secured and friendly place. I would recommend Li's place. I would love to stay there again!
164448,516209932,2019-08-24,38500148,Ricardo,everything was very good
170651,443898,2011-08-14,827381,Tamara,"Marie S is the best flat owner :)  The apartment looks just like the photos.  It was spotless, and she left delicious fresh fruit and coffee to welcome me to Stockholm.  The flat is located in an amazing location for long walks and is close to transportation all over Stockholm.  I can't say enough about how nice Marie is, and how lovely it was that she trusted me with her plants.  Also, the balcony is wonderful and romantic.  Love her and her flat.  "
170651,495351,2011-09-02,879815,Derk,"Nice location, well equipped kitchen, nice sunny balcony. If you are travelling with a small baby, as we did, it is good to know that the elevator is rather small. Our baby carriage did not fit in (unless dismounted), which was a bit impractical.Also, from the practical standpoint, we would have liked a normal size table and some more electric light (instead of the many candles), but I suppose this is a question of taste."
170651,580334,2011-09-29,958351,Stefano,Nice and clean apartment. Good location (close to subway). Very kind landlord.
170651,785773,2011-12-14,1309213,Audrey&Benoit,"Marie's place is totally cute and close to everything you need, supermarket down the street, great bars ,metro station ...The appartment was a real pleasure to stay in, really clean, feeling fresh and cosy, big enough for two . we loved it .Marie's been really great with us as well, from showing us things to check on the map to making sure everything was ok , an overall 5 stars experience. "
170651,1009721,2012-03-17,1814871,Olivia,"Lovely apartment and wonderful host!Close to metro and supermarket. "
170651,1117372,2012-04-12,1982414,Zoe,"At the risk of sounding sycophantic, I cannot recommend Marie and her apartment more highly! Marie is gorgeously friendly and helpful- going well beyond the duty of a host; I was welcomed by a cafetiere in the sun on her balcony and spent the next two hours chatting away and being given invaluable local tips and advice! The apartment is an oasis of bright, light calm and wonderfully located in vibrant Hornstull, just round the corner from the Tunnelbanna (although why anyone would take public transport in a city so lovely to walk around beats me). Five star stay in every way- the only downside was having to come back to London... Go to Stockholm, stay at Marie's, just don't you dare try to book the same days as me (I'll definitely be coming back)! Thank you so much again, Marie. Z x "
170651,1315141,2012-05-21,1328312,Adele,"We loved Marie's little heaven on the roof top! it was really cosy and we felt at home! Marie is really easy to deal with and we had no problem arranging for the keys even though our plane landed close to midnight.The area is really convenient! you will find nice little restaurants, supermarket, bakery, tube/bus station within few hundred metres. Also one of Stockholm beaches is not far from the flat.I'll be back in Stockholm and most probably in Marie's flat!"
170651,1674806,2012-07-10,2274023,Varvara,Thank Marie for wonderful staying in Stocholm! Apartment is very clean and cozy. Marie is very attentive owner. I advise everyone to stay in her apartment! 
170651,1738691,2012-07-18,552942,Shaun,"Marie's flat is lovely. Very chilled and bohemian. The local neighourhood is great - lots of nice coffee bars, cafes and close to the water. It's a bit more alternative than other parts of Stockholm we visited - and all the better for it. Metro is 5 mins walk away, so it's easy to get to the centre. Recommend it & Marie is really nice too."
170651,1881645,2012-08-04,2173519,Nicole,"Marie is just as lovely as her apartment. It is in a great location. You are close to everything great bars, cafes and the metro stop. Marie was accommodating, sweet and responsive. We had a wonderful time in Stockholm and owe much of it to Marie and her petite charm rooftop next to heaven. The name is very fitting. Thank you Marie!"
170651,4572117,2013-05-13,5827213,Patricia,"A lovely hostess, and a positive, zen, apartment... we had a lovely stay. Thank you Marie!"
170651,4800755,2013-05-27,2865466,Barbara,our stay in maries flat was perfect. highly recommended! 
170651,24377367,2014-12-27,13567048,Svenja,I stayed with my family around christmas in maries wonderful apartement. Everything was decorated so lovely and we felt very comfortable. Marie was very helpful with every questions we had and otherwise everything else went well too.
170651,30540383,2015-04-24,486398,Mikko,The reservation was canceled 61 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
170651,44317682,2015-08-25,34197258,Nadia,"The flat looks exactly like in the pictures, it is beautiful and neat with a lovely balcony. The area is great; public transport, shops, restaurants and parks are just around the corner. Marie is also a fantastic and welcoming host. Thank you Marie for letting us stay in your home!The only downside is that there is no WIFI in this flat (as advertised) and this caused me quite a problem as it prevented me from working. I got the code to the neighbours WIFI network but it would only work at times in the hallway. "
170651,79419650,2016-06-12,2479915,Alex,"The apartment is in a great location - close to major transit but also very quiet! Great layout, perfect for 2-3 people. The kitchen is very well equipped with basics. The beds are comfortable. The space itself is tight, but works well for a few people. There is no seating, however - which was an issue when making a sit-down meal. The patio/balcony was a great place to sit and enjoy the sun! Very easy to communicate with Marie. Wifi was great (except we accidentally unplugged the router thing, and it eventually ran out of battery and we struggled to figure out how to get internet back!) The room does not have dark curtains; hopefully not an issue for others. Bathroom was a little tight, but doable - no shower curtain, which was odd. I would recommend this place to anyone! Also, the cat is very cute, cuddly/friendly! "
170651,190042595,2017-09-03,135344339,Loveth,Nice apartment. I like the place.

170651,354746596,2018-12-02,128131847,Paulina,"HiMarie's place is great. Really comfy. In the kitchen there are all neccessary things. In the apartment there is a lot of plants which adds extra charm. No insects ! as i read in some mean comment here. Cat which will stay with you when Marie will be off is really sweet and he loves all people from first sight ( what was strange for me as cats usually don't like strangers:) ) Apartament is close to the subway and bus station. Next to the metro station ( so 4 min of walk) there are shops, cafes and similar places.  And communcation with Marie is really great-  on airbnb and via telephone. I recomend this place very very much!"

170651,446360534,2019-05-01,39507296,Ross,"Marie's home is a lovely green space, ideally located with a bus stop outside and super market and metro 5 min walk away. Most of Stockholm is 30-50min away depending on your choice of transport.We were lucky to have good weather and it was especially lovely to share a wine on the balcony after putting our baby to bed.A slight issue with cat hair and some allergies is the only reason we couldn't give Marie a perfect 5."
170651,451812170,2019-05-12,233826932,Angelika,Marie is very friendly ;) . The Appartement is lovely. We've spend a nice time there. Everything was fine. We will come back :)

220851,26153106,2015-02-05,505346,Elly,"I was here for a whole month and definitely recommend this place! The apartment is very nice, with a large room with good light. Very homely, filled with different artworks and with a good bathroom and kitchen. Lovely area, close to the T-bana and busses so it is convenient to get almost anywhere! There are also grocery stores, cafes, restaurants etc. within a couple of minutes of the apartment. Satya is a great host; very relaxed and happy to talk or leave you to yourself. Very happy to have met him, we had some good conversations :) He was also nice enough to extend my stay a few days at short notice."

The energy is great, its clean, quite and calming..also the area is very nice, with lots of nice restaurants,  coffeebars and shops! Frederic was very helpfull and helped me to find the way. I would stay here again anytime! "
220851,54073730,2015-11-15,16021696,Emily,The room is very cosy and warm. It's 3 mins walk to the Metro station which can lead you to city centre within 10-15mins. Very convenient. John has very detailed instruction on how to get his place from airport and he is a nice person in sharing his thoughts with us.
220851,62221134,2016-02-12,20426231,Julian,Super relaxed guy with a nice place. The room is indeed super quiet! It is located in a nice neighbourhood with some great cafe's and restaurants. Small thing is the lack of wifi.
220851,65562575,2016-03-15,50503468,Stephen,"Fredric made me feel very welcome, he can be good to talk to but also allows you your own space which is also nice.  He keeps the apartment clean and tidy.  The bedroom is big and spacious with a comfortable bed.  The best thing about this apartment is the location, it is walking within walking distance to most things and very close to a main T-bana (underground), train line and airport bus stop."
220851,73186104,2016-05-07,23800378,Leona,"I had a very good time at Fredric's place. He's a very easy-going and nice person who respects your privacy. His apartment is in a great spot, very convenient for people working at KI. It is bright with a super comfy bed and has this very calming vibe to it. Fredric gave me lots of helpful advice (cheapest supermarket, best yoga studio) and also let me use his kitchen and washing machine."
220851,74377479,2016-05-15,11321939,Ashley,"Fredric was a great host for my girlfriend and I, and has a lovely apartment in a great area just north of Kungsholmen in Stockholm. There are plenty of cafes and bars in the area, as well as shops for vintage items and home decor. Fredric was very non-intrusive and friendly, always accommodating us as best he could. While we didn't spend that much time together (we were only in Stockholm for the Eurovision Song Contest) Fredric gave us good tips on the area and communicated with us well both before and during our trip. The room is spacious, bright, and the bed is incredibly comfortable. The room perhaps becomes a little light in the morning as there are only blinds over the windows - that's our only real criticism. Otherwise, a great, calm stay in an apartment with a really minimalist, soothing atmosphere."
220851,75565359,2016-05-22,67850073,Chengkai,Fredric is a really nice people and helps me a lot!

The apartment is beautiful, clean and minimalistic. There are most of the standard equipment there. The room is spacious, bright and the bed is comfortable too. The location is also very good: metro station, supermarkets, bakery shop, restaurants etc all in 5 mins walking distance, 10mins metro ride to the center of the city. I really recommend this place!"
220851,100211002,2016-09-08,31486395,Douglas,"Fredric made me most welcome in his home. Fredric is a tremendous  host! His knowledge of the city is great. He made several suggestions that made my brief visit to Stockholm a pleasure. Should I ever find myself in Stockholm again, I would certainly look to stay at his residence again. Thank you Fredric! Douglas "

The train station is really close by. Plenty of shops and wifi places near. Also great food places very close by. The only problem I had is that there wasn't wifi. For Americans that can be a problem because my phone didn't work without wifi.
220851,188980761,2017-08-31,63304128,Shao-Cheng,"Fredric's place is awesome! Like the interior of his apartment! The room itself is spacious and comfy, and its location is nice as well. Few mins walk to the subway station, within 10-12 mins u can get to central station! And Fredric is a great host too, I'd recommend his place ~~"
220851,191581362,2017-09-08,6508824,Jessica,Please know wifi is not available in the apartment. Shower head is not fixed on wall and not the very convenient kind especially for women with long hair to wash. Big and comfortable bed.

It is conveniently located in the city with all the facilities needed in the walking distance (supermarket, restaurants, coffee shops, 7-11 convient shops, subway station and the airport bus).

242188,917789,2012-02-13,1612490,Mike,"Lovely host and ideal location for Sodermalm as well as getting to the exhibition centre where I was working. Lidia gave me the double room as it was available which was perfect, but this single room looked just as good. Tasty, filling breakfast. Wifi worked great too. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a base to explore Stockholm"
242188,944467,2012-02-23,1746523,Anke,Thanks to Lidia I had a wonderful stay in Stockholm. She is very kind and helpful and her appartment is conveniently located. I definitly recommend to stay with her.

She is a fabulous host, she goes out of her way to help provide information on Stockholm and goes that extra mile to make guests comfortable. If I get the chance to come back to Stockholm I would stay with Lidia again! Oh, and you MUST try her breakfasts- they're fantastic!"

242188,1266971,2012-05-12,2131857,Teona,"Lidia's apartment is perfectly located, central and at the same time in quite district, everything what tourist might need is close by. Apartment is clean, neat and cosy. Bed is fantastic....But the main beauty of this apartment is its hostess - Lidia. She is amazing, wonderful and welcoming lady who tells you much more than is written in any book or web about Stockholm and Sweden in general.I 100% recommend Lidia's B&B, as missing this opportunity to get to know Lidia means that you've just passed by the Stockholm.P.S. Her breakfasts are just separate phenomenon, that shouldn't be missed. "
242188,1304824,2012-05-19,2182133,Bree,Great location & easy to use public transportation. Very clean & quiet space to stay in. Lidia met me for arrival & explained everything on her map of Stockholm over a cup of tea. Thanks.
242188,1386109,2012-05-30,2446996,Ken,From the moment I met Lidia she made me feel very welcome to stay in her comfortable home. I tend to stay to myself and this is a real change for me to stay in someones home. I have been in Sweden for over a month and I have never had a better sleep than what I had at Lidias.  She cannot seem to do enough for you. I have already passed her name along to a colleage of mine who frequently has people coming to Sweden on business. When you stay at Lidias you would be remissed to not take advantaged of her breakfast.
242188,1423161,2012-06-05,2223112,Anthony,"Lidia was an exceptional host and my stay was made extremely comfortable. Lidia was very accommodating even though I arrived late, and she even fed me a snack because all the stores were closed! The location of the apartment is superb, and I could not have asked for a better experience with this host. Conversations amongst tea and coffee were always pleasant! Thank you Lidia!"
242188,1479816,2012-06-14,2340667,Danielle,"I spent 5 wonderful days in Stockholm, staying at Lidia's! She's a great host, very welcoming and friendly. She gave me a lot of useful information about Stockholm, what to see and what to, when to go and how to get there. And she prepares an excellent breakfast !  I loved our chats over breakfast and in the evening, it really added this little extra to my holiday. Recommended !"
242188,1534057,2012-06-22,1668206,Jane,Very pleasant room and flat (plus a generous breakfast) in central Stockholm location. Would certainly recommend. Thanks Lid for everything!
242188,1581472,2012-06-28,376196,Michael,"I had a great stay here. The apartment is easy to get to from the central station. Lidia was very helpful, helping me get a phone card sorted out, and planning a trip up north."
242188,1662560,2012-07-09,2088524,Carol,"I thoroughly enjoyed my short time in Stockholm and the great acccommodation provided by Lidia contributed massively to this. Her flat is comfortable, in a superb location and her breakfasts lived up to all the rave reviews I had read. (The breakfast chats were also enjoyable). Lidia is extremely welcoming, and keen for you to have the best experience of this wonderful city. I am an independent type of traveller and the best thing about staying with Lidia is that she is really attentative but not in the least intrusive - just the perfect mix. Can't recommend it enough. Thank you Lidia."
242188,1966649,2012-08-13,2440946,Woosang,"Comfortable house and warmhearted host! I could enjoy running along Sodermalm seaside, visiting Gamlastan on foot, shopping at SoFo and drinking at various pubs during my one month stay. "
242188,2052424,2012-08-21,787427,James,"Lidia is a very cool host. Her place is very well located and comfortable. Very nice to talk to her about her life experiences. I highly recommend having her breakfasts. She sets out quite a spread for only 50 Krowns. It is a great way to start the morning. Make sure you follow her instructions on taking the J to her apartment and you will be set finding her. The bed was really comfortable . Especially after sleeping on Russian ferrys. I plan on coming back to Stockholm next summer and will definitely be asking Lidia if she has a room for me. "
242188,2279364,2012-09-14,3201310,Dov,"Lidia is extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  I would definitely recommend her as a host."

242188,2454065,2012-09-30,3233970,Mohini,"I had a very pleasant stay at Lidia's and would recommend it to anyone.  Lidia is very welcoming, anticipates your needs, gives you the right amount of privacy, is very well-travelled and knowledgeable, and gives great tips on getting around the city.  Her home is located in a fairly central neighbourhood, a 5-10 minute easy walk from the metro and commuter trains. The area is bustling in the evenings, with lots of restaurants and bars.  The old town is a 15 minute walk away. The room was clean and quiet, and the bed very comfortable.  I got back very late each night and that's not a problem as long as you are respectful of the other guests and don't make any noise. Walking back late at night was also completely safe. There are 3-4 rooms located off the first floor landing, including a bathroom which everyone shares and which is very clean. There are shared tea/coffee making facilities and Lidia was very accommodating in providing me with the use of an iron and ironing board.  Breakfast is very generous. Overall, a great B&B."
242188,2656418,2012-10-19,2884012,Lina,Lidia was a very kind and friendly person. The house is well located therefore I highly recommend it. Breakfast was yummy.

242188,3005855,2012-12-02,3137812,Kristina,Lidia is very helpful in recommending things to do and anything you may need while you stay in Stockholm. The room is very close to the station and lots of things in that area of Stockholm. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone wanting to stay in Stockholm. 
242188,4297662,2013-04-25,6030190,Phoebe,"I thought this was great! Lidia was very sweet and helpful, while also respectful of privacy, etc. House, bed, and bathroom were all very clean and comfortable, especially compared to some other European hotels of similar price range! Wifi worked like a charm. Location is good too-- I walked pretty much everywhere (and I mean everywhere), but it was also easy to hop on the train or a bus."
242188,4513778,2013-05-10,4265835,Elfa,Lidia es muy amable... Te ayuda con tips... Todo esta muy limpio.
242188,4591467,2013-05-14,4206259,Kirsty,"I had an amazing time with Lidia. She is very kind and very helpful, I enjoyed my stay very much. The room is spacious with a big window and very clean, you can find all the things you need! Although it was a shared-bathroom I had no problem at all! Lidia is a very sweet lady, the breakfasts were so good (with lots of food!). If I come back to Stockholm in the future I will definitely stay at Lidia's place again. "
242188,4994732,2013-06-06,5510305,Melanie,"Lidia is very nice, her apartment is quiet and well situated. Very easy to reach to and from the airport. Guest rooms are upstairs in the duplex and Lidia lives downstairs. The breakfast is a must. "
242188,5167811,2013-06-16,6690168,Dana,"Lidia was really wonderful.  She was very helpful telling me about good things to see in Stockholm and giving me tips on how to save some money.  Her directions from the airport to her house were very good.  Her apartment is easy to get to from the airport.  You get on a commuter train and the stop is a five minute walk to her apartment.  After my check-out time was past, she really showed her true colors helping me above and beyond the call of duty.  I am most appreciative for her help at that time.  Her apartment is perfectly set up for guests with rooms on a second floor.  I highly recommend Lidia!"
242188,5207108,2013-06-18,5551954,Kristin,Lidia is very friendly and gives you tipps at the arrival. I came in the morning and could leave my luggage there. There is a shared bathroom for all guests which was clean and a common area with micro wave and fridge where you could eat in the evening.
242188,6226633,2013-08-04,6822888,Carolina,"The stay at Lidia's was most comfortable. The street and area in general are very quiet and friendly for walking around. The location is perfect from commuter train, also from subway although slightly further.There are some buses around the corner but I did not use them.The flat itself is spacious and luminous, very clean and with all commodities well set up. I stayed in a single room which provided an extremely cozy bed and direct sunlight in the morning. Storage space was also more than sufficient. The bathroom is very spacious and clean too. .The fact that the guest rooms are one floor above from homeowner gives a good sense of privacy. Besides, each room comes with a key to have it locked. Still, meeting Lidia in the kitchen is a wonderful time to spend, she is most helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to transport, visiting the city and touring around. She really is a wonderful host, I will definitely keep her in my list when I visit Stockholm next time. Thank you Lidia for all your kind help!"
242188,6273050,2013-08-06,6353367,Nicole,"Lidia is a great host -very sweet and friendly! It was really great to have a separate large bathroom for guests on the 2nd floor where the rooms are located, plus a fridge and area for preparing coffee & tea in a common living room area. Thanks for the additional travel advice and free maps and allowing me to stay longer in the afternoon due to an evening flight!"
242188,6519654,2013-08-15,7741937,Barbara,"I enjoyed my stay with Lidia. I arrived fairly late due to some issues with the train, but it was no problem at all. The place was very conveniently located, just around the corner from a train station. Lidia was very welcoming and helpful and even gave me the chance to practise my Swedish a little!  "
242188,7353697,2013-09-16,7565272,Fezeh,"It was amazing to stay with Lidia. She is very kind and sweet lady. We had very nice discussions during the evenings and at breakfast tables.

242188,13425807,2014-05-27,3137812,Kristina,"This is my second time staying with Lidia - she was always a great, courteous host offering me advice and help. The location is perfect - both the commuter train and the metro always run through the stop near her place since it's one stop south of T Centralen - so you always can get home or to wherever else very quickly. The rooms are comfy and have space to put your things. "
242188,13814437,2014-06-05,7059376,Michelle,"I had a great stay in Lidias apartment. it was a perfect location to get to the conference centre. Lidia gave tourist advice, helped with directions and even lent me a charger whether mine died. She went above and beyond what was required as a host."

She welcomed me at the door with tea and kanelbulle (cinnamon buns) and gave me an overview of the area, pointing out her favourite things to see. For an extra 50kronor Lidia can provide breakfast (and conversation). The area around Lidia's flat is quiet and safe but very close to central Sodermalm's bars and restaurants. It's an easy walk to Gamla Stan with some fine views on the way."

242188,32511363,2015-05-19,28887156,Oliver,"I had a wonderful stay at Ms. Lidia's place.  Lidia is a very welcoming and gracious host.  She provides great travel tips if you are visiting Stockholm as a tourist.  Her apartment is located in a convenient location, close to two metro lines.  There are a few rooms, like a small bed & breakfast.  I took the smallest room, which is perfect for a solo traveller.  There are also double rooms available.  I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Stockholm."
242188,34472972,2015-06-08,29483133,Leonard,"Lidia has been an extremely wonderful host. Very polite, friendly and gives a very warm welcome when you arrive. Details provided to the address was more than sufficient in navigating to the apartment. Apartment has a very cozy feeling and the room directly faces an open park with a good view of the outside and plenty of ventilation. Apartment is also located close to some of the neighbourhood's most beautiful viewing points of Stockholm up at Mariatorget. If you are intending to visit Stockholm and want somewhere nice and cozy to stay in Sodermalm, do consider staying with Lidia!"
242188,36653216,2015-06-30,27220846,Fabian,"todo bien, Lidia fue una excelente anfitrion, muy generosa y gentil, muy buenos sus desayunos, ademas muy buena ubicacion del departamento y habitacion en un barrio muy tranquilo y hermoso. lo recomiendo 100%. "
242188,36986792,2015-07-03,3877726,Grace,Lydia was a wonderful host; she helped me understand the neighborhood and the best way to spend my short amount of time in Stockholm. It felt just like home! She was even kind enough to make me a delicious breakfast for 50 Kronos each day which filled me up for my adventures.
242188,37644322,2015-07-09,29249764,Isabel,Lidia was caring and solicitous of my needs. I enjoyed my chats with her. The bed was possibly the most comfortable I've slept on during my four week trip. The location was very handy. I'd recommend a stay at Lidia's to anyone.
242188,38171638,2015-07-13,31878236,Nimmi,"I absolutely enjoyed staying at Lidia's place. She was very helpful with directions to her place. Once I reached her place, she had maps marked with interesting stuff for me.Her place is very nice and clean and located closed to train and bus stops. Lidia is a very sweet and pleasant person."
242188,38625402,2015-07-17,18426026,Xi,"Perfact location,very close to a train station,grocery store,a square with bars and restaurants, and the metro station,too. Lidia's house is very lovely and the room I stayed is quite comfortable. And the thing impressed me most is that Lidia and her relatives are all so nice!"
242188,40211155,2015-07-29,33218517,Rosa,"Lidia is a fantastic host. She helps you solve anything you may need. The room is great, very luminous because of the huge window it has. Moreover the views are amazing. Everything is clean and comfortable. If I came back to Stockholm, i would definately stay here again. Location is great too."
242188,40836529,2015-08-02,13127945,Alejandra,"Lidia was a most welcoming host. I felt at home right away. She was full of information and good advice.

242188,44288297,2015-08-25,2129366,Laura,Lidia was very welcoming and helpful in giving information about the city. Thank you! 
242188,44611346,2015-08-27,7414627,Louise,"Lidia was an amazing host, very helpful with information, what is the easiest, what is the cheapest. Always there for you, but never intrusive, I Will definitely recommend! :)"
242188,44897370,2015-08-30,33801158,Elisabeth,"The room was as good as I had expected and Lidia as nice as I had hoped. The location is great, it is very easy to get into town, only a few minutes away from public transport and close enough to the center to walk there. It is quiet at night and I felt like coming home after long days walking around Stockholm. Having read previous reviews, I also decided to book breakfast which was a good idea.It was my first airbnb-experience but hopefully not my last and should I come back to Stockholm, I am sure to try and stay with Lidia again. It is great to be able to travel this way as a 60+ person and also great to have a 60+ host as welcoming and interesting as Lidia. Thanks a lot, Lidia."
242188,45304298,2015-09-01,19253859,Chris,"Lidia was a very good host and nice lady.  She sent explicit and detailed directions on how to get to her apartment.  She was also waiting for me upon my arrival direct from SFO, which was very welcoming.  The room is small but very clean as is the entire apartment and bathroom.   There is a basic desk, nightstand and single bed.   The bathroom is shared with other guests.   There were kids playing outside and I had to leave the window open for air so you can hear them playing but the neighborhood is very suburban and quiet with very few cars around.  It was very peaceful and serene.  It is a 5-10 minute walk to any food or restaurant so there's no much immediately below the complex but the train is closely.Lidia spent a lot of time to give me tips on where to go and what to see in Stockholm.  She answered all my questions and was a great host.  She looked after me with times that my train was leaving the next morning and provided anything I asked for (i.e. adapter).  "
242188,45599868,2015-09-04,19005461,Karandeep (KD),"I had a swell time at Lidia's place.  The neighborhood she lives in is excellent and downtown Stockholm is only one train station away.  Lidia is an awesome host -  very welcoming and very helpful.  For instance on my last day I had to take a train to the airport and had gone out for a bit to check out the neighborhood. When I came back Lidia had a small slip of paper listing the available train times and the connecting bus times and the bus number that I would need.  On my first day Lidia helped me with sight seeing trips given my time constraints.  The room is quite comfortable for a single person and has a nice bed.  The bathroom is a shared one.Given another chance I would definitely stay at Lidia's place."
242188,47043458,2015-09-15,37572400,Amanda,"This was a great place to stay -- the pictures and descriptions are accurate.  I took an overnight flight to Stockholm & Lidia was kind enough to let me in to drop off my luggage in the morning, which was wonderful.  The SL train stop near her place is on the same line as Arlanda airport, which made it very easy to get to & her directions from the train stop to the apartment made the place very easy to find."
242188,47311337,2015-09-17,22175879,Andrew,"I don't have enough space to leave an adequate  review for Lidia and her place. To begin with, Lidia was waiting at the front door to the building when I arrived despite only having an estimate for when I might be there.  She had tea and snacks waiting after I settled into my room and mapped out various spots in the city to explore.  Lidia was responsive without being intrusive and she even went out of her way to help me with laundry in the basement while I was out. In terms of the space, it was perfect for my quick stop in Stockholm, only a few blocks from the train to the airport and close to the action on Gotgagan street and in Old Town.   My room was clean along with the shared bathroom, and there was very little noise at night.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants an authentic Stockholm experience at a reasonable price. Thanks again Lidia."
242188,48319206,2015-09-25,43564086,Elga,"First of all want to say that I  couldn't really believe in comments here until I saw it with my eyes and thank you all lovely people here for honest reviews !  The room looked like exactly the way it looks like on the pictures!  Everything was very tidy, clean, very nice atmosphere and quiet. No motorbike noises by night from the street  ( was very important to me.. ) One has really  everything for relaxing there. The area the apartment is located in is very close to the city center and has  very good access to the public transport. Lidia is an amazing host, she was very helpful and gave me a very detailed explanation of the way to her apartment,so I could get there very easily.I must mention I still got free coffee,tee ect. even though I did not order breakfest !I would very much recommend her place for staying in Stockholm if you're on holidays or even for your business trip on a budget."
242188,49336926,2015-10-03,5689973,Barbara,"This place worked out well. It was about 5 minutes from the commuter train (handy for coming from main train station in Stockholm) and 10 to 15 minutes to the Metro (a bus stop was closer if you preferred.) It's also about 15 minutes to walk to SoFo, Stockholm's hipster area, if you like trendy restaurants etc. There is also a street that is closed to traffic that has fashion clothing stores like Gina Tricot (similar to H&M), about 15 to 20 minutes walking distance.The room was small but cozy and comfortable. There are other rooms so you will meet other guests and hear their them in the shared common area but overall that wasn't an issue. Lidia was very helpful with maps and suggestions of things to do, and tips about public transit. "
242188,49598434,2015-10-05,37869951,Melanie,"I felt very welcome when I arrive at Lidia's. She kindly offered me a cup of tea and explained me about the area and the main tourist attractions in Stockholm. The room was cosy and had a nice view on the city, perfect for a weekend! The flat itself is very well located with train station 3 min away and other metro station 5-10 min away and at a walkable distance to cafes, bars and Slussen. "
242188,49980337,2015-10-08,26075869,Fred,"I arrived late from my flight and local train to her neighborhood but Lidia was waiting for me at midnight. Her instructions on getting to the apartment from airport was very clear and I had no problems. The neighborhood was very nice with many cafes, restaurants and grocery stores.  It was situated near public transportation and located to all the places I wanted to see.  She helped me with some recommendations, the cost and how to get there. The description of the room was exactly  told and the photos were exact.  I just needed a simple bedroom, clean and quiet and that was what I got. She was very kind to me."
242188,50661184,2015-10-13,7878388,Judit,"I spent 4 nights in a cozy room in an apartment situated very closely to Central Stockholm. What I appreciate the most and what I was looking for when choosing Airbnb was that I did not just stay there as a tourist but that I had the occasion to interaction with my host, Mrs. Kuhn, and have some nice cultural exchange as well.  The real apartment and the listing match 100%."
242188,51081222,2015-10-17,2590110,Erika,"Lidia kindly met me at the door (even though my arrival time was a moving target), and helped me with my luggage. What's more, after a long drive, she served me tea and dinner. I tried to return the favor with a cake from a local bakery, and we spent an evening in heartfelt discussion. I feel lucky to have stayed here, and the other guests were kind too. "
242188,51443853,2015-10-20,17638407,Craig,"The room was comfortable with a good view, and Lidia was extremely friendly, welcoming, and helpful with ideas for what to see and do around Stockholm. I'd definitely stay again!"
242188,51713606,2015-10-24,41974675,Isabelle,"Lidia is a most welcoming host, full of useful and interesting information about things to see round Stockholm. The accomodation is as described, comfortable, warm, very practical. The situation is perfect for visiting Gamla Stan and the surrounding areas, everything is within walking distance, and for those who prefer public transfer, the train station and bus stations are just round the corner. Also most appreciable is the free wifi connection, kettle, tea, coffee, fridge and microwave. "
242188,52493734,2015-10-30,13502321,Xue Peng,"Lidia is one of the most welcoming host I ever met via airbnb. She woke up early to wait for me as my flight was supposed to arrive early morning. When I arrived, she served me tea and shared with me tips and advices on where to visit, provided me with brochures and maps to assist. The location and accommodation was same as described - Nice cozy room in a central location. The apartment is clean, and neighbourhood is safe enough to walk in the streets at night. I stayed at Lidia's place for 5 nights, and often we find ourselves engaging in hour long conversations around many topics, ranging from travel to politics.

The flat is close to bus stops and train stops and is one stop away from central station. It is about a 45 min ride to and from Arlanda airport.

242188,94641936,2016-08-16,6773572,Laura,"I spent 4 lovely and relaxing nights in Lidia's single room. The rooms are located on the upper level of her 2-story apartment. There is one single room and 2 double rooms. There is one bathroom for all three rooms. There are locks on all the doors and a common area equipped with a mini-fridge, hot water heater, eating utensils and a microwave. Great wifi and quite clean.   Had no problem with the other guests and with sharing a bathroom. Great experience. Room: cozy and cute. I didn't spend much time there so the size of the room did not bother me at all. Lidia was great and made sure the trash was emptied every day. I had enough towels, a water glass and she even made my bed. :). There is a desk in the room with 2 lamps along with an overhead lamp. The room faces a playground area/park so sometimes you will hear kids playing soccer but it was not a problem for me. It does get plenty of light (I actually had sunshine during my trip to Stockholm) so it made me wish I had brought my eye mask.  Location: Great location. Public transportation (T-bana & bus stops) around the corner. Near yummy bakeries and delicious coffee houses. I had an early morning cruise on the Viking Line. It was an easy 30-min walk to their harbor. She lives on the 5th floor of her building but there is a great elevator. Lidia is a great host and she wants to be a resource to her guests. She gave me great directions to her apartment from Arlanda. Once I arrived, we had coffee and she talked to me about Stockholm and all that it has to offer. She was very kind and you can tell she enjoy hosting us tourists. It was nice to come home to a friendly face -- she even remembered some of my random Stockholm travel plans!  Thank you, Lidia. "
242188,97096905,2016-08-25,24741850,Diana,"Lidia was a magnificent host. She replied to all my questions immediately and 1 week before arrival time, she sent me the perfect instructions on getting to her home. We took the train directly from the airport to her Stockholm Sodra stop, it was perfect and easy. It took a little less than an hour. If you have any questions about the trains at the airport, at Terminal 4 there is an information center - you can also buy the train ticket there. We bought a 7 day travel card because we were there 9 days - we used it good. There is an additional 85 Kr (~$10) fee to get on this commuter train from the airport but it was worth it.My parents joined me on my trip. I got the single room and my parents got one of the double rooms. I didn't know there were 2 double rooms, the other one has 2 separate twin beds. All 3 rooms share the bathroom. At first, I thought this would be a problem but it never was.My single room was spacious enough and faced the playground. Noise-wise, you can hear the kids playing, no biggie, noise doesn't start till 8 am. At night time, you hear the people talking but it stops around 11-11:30 pm, no later.I really loved the neighborhood. If I ever go back, I'd stay in that area again. It was accessible to everything. The buses and trains were all nearby. So are the restaurants and parks. You  can walk to Gamla Stan if you want to check out the area - about 1.5 miles from her home. I felt safe at all times. Lidia's suggestions/guidance was very helpful and valuable. She's very nice and you can tell she enjoys being a host. My parents really enjoyed her company too, especially during breakfast. My parents wanted breakfast every morning so they paid to get it. She offered bread, cheeses, prosciutto, ham, fruits, jam and more. I provided my own breakfast since I have a sensitive stomach.Lidia is very enjoyable and easy to speak with. I highly recommend her."
242188,98021560,2016-08-29,76850236,Haruka,"Her hospitality was perfect!!She was always kind for me:)And she told me how to go the sightseeing sight or some Swedish words!

She gave me advice on trains and buses, and she also had about 5 map/schedules/museums/etc in English for me to use while I was there. It was a great help. She offered me tea and discussed a lot of options I had while I was there. She is a great resource.Where I stayed was upstairs and it was all mine. There are 2 rooms that she rents out, but I was the only one at that time. There was a TV, tea kettle, fridge, and I think a microwave in the living room area that was up there. Very spacey."

242188,284205596,2018-07-01,152611851,Mariah,"Li was great! So friendly and helpful. The place was cozy and very clean. I felt so at home for being so far away. Her place is located very close to everything you need, while being in a quieter part of town for a nice break at the end of the day."
242188,289927505,2018-07-13,26478839,Eric,Li was very friendly and very helpful with any questions I had. The room was comfortable and is perfectly located in a very central location.

242188,315141036,2018-08-28,22944766,Laura,"Li is a lovely host, as a solo female traveler I felt safe at all times at her place. It is in a nice area, close to public transport and very quiet at night (great for sleeping). There is a fridge and microwave to heat up any food you need, plus tea and coffee. The bathroom was very clean and great pressure in the shower, always nice to warm up after a long day exploring. Li was fantastic as a host and gave great tips for traveling around and what to see. Check in was a breeze, my flight got in at midnight, as it was delayed. Li was so kind and stayed up until 2 am giving me helpful directions from the airport to her place and getting me settled into her apartment. She went above and beyond that night and I felt so safe knowing that in a foreign city she was there to help me even though I arrived so late. She also let me leave my bags at her place on the final day (I had a night flight) so I could finish my time in Stockholm without having to drag around my luggage. I highly recommend this Airbnb and Li!"
242188,346630295,2018-11-09,172657,Krishna,"Very cozy apartment with plenty of space in the private room and a nice living room just outside. A clean spacious bathroom as well.

242188,352411714,2018-11-25,20505608,Charlotte,"I had a lovely stay at Li's. She is super nice, helpful and welcoming and has a lot of cute attentions for her guests (like a tea when you arrive and a great explanation of the map and the city). I loved discussing with Li and she helped me with many things while I was there travelling alone (advice about visits, transport...). I felt like home  !The place is super confortable and close to the city center. I highly recommend this place :) :)"

The apartment location is top notch, in a cool area and very close to major metro stops and buses.  Li will make you feel welcome and leave you in private.  Highly recommended."

242188,413250633,2019-02-17,69098348,Jessica,"Amazing place! Staying with Li was like staying with family. She is very kind, welcoming and friendly- with lots of local tips and info on what to see and how to get there. Li has a gorgeous and spacious home, close to transport, or walking distance to the food and music district and old town if you prefer to explore on foot. I had a great stay, would definitely recommend. I was the only guest when I stayed and had the top floor of the apartment to myself, with a bathroom, kettle and fridge and comfy sitting area full of light and plants and a big bathroom."

242188,440743320,2019-04-21,243329322,An,"Een fijne, nette kamer met mooi uitzicht, maar de gordijnen laten wel veel licht door. Denk daaraan, als je in de lente/zomer gaat. De badkamer is ruim en de douche is heel goed, meteen warm water. Dat het toilet niet apart is, is soms wat lastig, als er andere gasten zijn en je dus moet wachten. Maar Li zei me wel maximaal drie gasten tegelijk te ontvangen. In de woonkamer staan heel wat boeken en een tv-toestel, een waterkoker en een microgolfoven. Water, thee en koffie zijn beschikbaar. En ook servies en bestek. Ik mocht ook haar keuken gebruiken om te koken en af te wassen. Li antwoordde heel snel op mijn berichten, heeft me goed uitgelegd hoe ik van de luchthaven tot bij haar geraakte en stond me op te wachten. Ze kan je heel wat info geven over wat te zien en te doen in en rond Stockholm. Ze legt je ook uit hoe ergens te geraken met het openbaar vervoer en zo.  En daarnaast hebben we heel wat gezellige babbels gehad over vanalles en nog wat :-) (Ik studeer Zweeds en dat was dus ook een goede oefening voor mij.)"
242188,445887074,2019-04-30,37242035,Denis,Lee met me with all hospitality and gave me very useful advices for the city. Her house is in a beautiful  silent place and around 3 min from commute train station. So getting to the city center takes around 5-10 minutes. Also her house quite near to the hipster part of Stockholm around 10-15 min walk.  So you can easily access great pubs and venues where you can spend evening.
242188,449708515,2019-05-07,12886826,Adele,Li's place is in a great location for using the trains and buses to explore Stockholm.  Li is available for advice about what to visit and how to get there.  Her place has cafes and supermarkets nearby.  It is a safe neighbourhood.  The set up of her place allows you to be quite independent.  I really enjoyed staying there.
242188,455116690,2019-05-19,27039205,Alice,"A very homey and cozy apartment with each access to major transportation options nearby. Room is clean and bedding comfortable. Bathroom is shared with other travelers, but there is a separate living room space for all to share too. Li was very nice and offered quite some sightseeing tips upon my arrival."

242188,513357384,2019-08-19,23544463,Kathleen,Li welcomed me into her lovely home with tea and tips on places to visit. I was here for a conference and the room I was in had a wonderful view and was a great place to write. I loved the view... and sodermalm!
259025,740869,2011-11-23,1417824,ChienChang,"The location is not that far as I saw on map. It takes only 16 minutes to the main station by subway. Meanwhile, you will never find such huge and cozy bedroom in the town. Th host Ali is so hospitable. Anyway I'm happy that I made a good choice. "
259025,800122,2011-12-22,1407831,Nilojan,The house looked great and neat and Ali was so helpful but things didn't allowed me to spend more time with him :-)
259025,824084,2012-01-02,1428285,Carina,"It was a nice and cosy room, close to metro and 15 minutes to the city center. Host was also really friendly and helpful. 4 stars only because the room was in the 2nd floor and the bath on the ground floor."
259025,894265,2012-01-31,1596403,Karla,"The house is really nice and the bedroom is cozy.The only problem is that the room is in the third floor and the bathroom is in the ground floor. It is just 15 minutes from the center of stockholm , and Ali is really helpful. He helped us with metro's issues, and still borrowed us a a big useful map of the city. There are some little restaurants and a supermarket in the neighborhood . We really recommend ali, we couldn't have made a better choice. "
259025,1024813,2012-03-20,1844516,Crystal,"Ali was really welcomed and nice host, my friend and I were spending a weekend in stockholm at Ali's place. the room is really clean and cozy.we had a great experience in Stockholm. Also, his place is convenient to reach by T-bana (metro), takes about 20 mins to get to the center. Highly recommended to stay at his place :)"
259025,1069545,2012-04-01,447374,Venus,"We are two girls from the UK. We enjoyed our stay and Ali is very nice and helpful. At first its a bit hard to find the house as there are not enough roadsigns in most part of Stockholm, and they are mostly swedish. Nevertheless, we found the house and it is very pretty and well organised. We love the kitchen especially!!! Ali is very kind to us and to save budgets, we are allowed to cook in his kitchen. everything is perfect! We will surely recommend others to stay at Ali's!!!!"
259025,1088639,2012-04-06,1599955,Miriam,"ali is a great host, his place was very comfy and spacious enough for the two of us! and a nice surprise to have breakfast! very accommodating with being able to use the kitchen. *****"
259025,1257126,2012-05-10,1928724,Elena,"Ali and his daughters are exellent host! House is really situated  very close  to the city center, but don't forget to print a map of the house before you go! A pleasent surprise is a tasty breakfast! Thank you, Ali for the great time in Stockholm! I Wish you and girls all the best! I would recommend this place to everyone!"
259025,1291128,2012-05-16,2223755,Agnese E Michele,"Ali is a really kind person and always helpfull with the guest. the house is really clean and the room too. the house is near to the metro and bus, just a few minutes walk. A great thanks to Ali again."
259025,1382654,2012-05-30,299453,Karla,"Ali's place was nice, he helped us with all info we needed, and he surprised us with breakfast for the 3 days we stayed there. the house is also good located ( just 8 metro stops from downtown). the only minus point will be that the bathroom was on the first floor) and our room was on the third floor but we knew that before we booked :) . i will recommend Ali's place to people who are not looking for luxus and who are easygoing :) "
259025,1410859,2012-06-04,851364,Hye-Won,"Sorry for late comment. I have been busy! Ali was very nice. I recommend anybody to stay in Ali's place!!!:)"
259025,1465858,2012-06-12,2100948,Ben,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Stockholm, Sweden for 9 days and 4 days was with Ali. We were very satisfied with our accommodations. He provided us security, free breakfast and a map. The room we stayed was larger than the originally reserved and he provided us with a TV just for us. Although we weren't at the house very much, the times we were we felt very comfortable and like home. His house is very cozy and warm. The subway was 7 min walk. Ali is always available for questions. We would definitely recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for expensive hotels in Stockholm."
259025,1503410,2012-06-18,105836,Guy,Ali was a very nice host. We had a bit of confusion finding the place so he came and picked up our suitcase in the city and left us the key. 
259025,1638588,2012-07-05,1600405,Joe,"Ali was out of town while we were visiting but arranged everything and our stay went very smoothly.  The apartment is beautiful and is a great value, especially compared to the high prices of hotels in Stockholm.  It took us about a half hour by train to get from the apartment to downtown, but the apartment is located very close to the station.  If you don't mind staying outside of the downtown area I would highly recommend this location."
259025,1770605,2012-07-22,2780873,Natalee,"We stade 2 nightsConvenient place, close to the metroClean apartmentHospitable hostHe provided assistance on any matterThanks Ali"
259025,1804567,2012-07-26,1427624,Jessica,"Ali's accommodation provided us with a clean, quiet place to stay during our visit to Stockholm. As expensive as Stockholm is, Ali's room provided an affordable option for budget travelers. Ali's generosity is evident in his willingness to share his living space and assist travelers in navigating the city and their visit.We were unaware of other travelers staying in the house prior to our arrival, which we would have liked to have known in advance.  "
259025,2059827,2012-08-21,1338310,Simon,"The house was really clean more than our expectation and also Ali is friendly and supportive to help guests to visit city. Due to his experience for managing guests he is professional in hospitality and providing peaceful environment for guests. As an overview I would say that we were really satisfy to stay his house and it was better than hotel in comparison to price and services. It is recommended for young travelers. "
259025,2756122,2012-10-29,3689433,Dror&Shiri,We stayed at Ali's for 2 nights. The house is near the train station and it is fully equipped and very comfortable and so is the room. Ali is very nice and friendly.  we really enjoyed our stay.
259025,2915328,2012-11-19,1702045,Erik,Thank you for hosting us! Ali is a very friendly and helpful host. Nice room and close to the Tunnelbana station/city center. I can strongly recommend Ali and his rooms :)
259025,2975702,2012-11-26,1710964,Lauren,house was very nice and clean. It wasnt super close to the city but wasnt to bad to get to either. 
259025,3163704,2012-12-27,4027603,Jeffrey,"Ali's house is clean, tidy & spacious. It's definitely a comfortable place to stay in & it is about a 10 mins walk to the metro. He is also very helpful & granted us help when needed. He also helped us get breakfast over the Christmas season - which was kind of him. It was a nice experience staying with Ali & I would recommend his place if you are looking for a home away from home.  "
259025,4443211,2013-05-06,3347756,Alexandra,"Advantages: very closed to Subway (5-7 min), 20 min to the Center.The room is suitible for 1-2 persons.We were able to use fridge and microvawe.Tea and coffee in the morning if neseccaryAli is nice and helpful man.Comparing to all the Stokcholm, the price is low.Disadvantages:We were with our baby, so the room was small for 3 persons and it was very stuffy.The worst thing is that the toilet is on the first floor, we lived on the third... During the night it war really uncomfortable to go down. Besides, the toilet and bathroom is for ALL guests who stay at the house.The ladder creacked loudly so that I woke up every time one of geusts went down."
259025,4862160,2013-05-29,6024909,Rebecca,"Ali was a friendly and warm host to us. He was helpful and answered all our questions.His place is not in the centre of Stockholm but it's easy to take the metro ( about 15 minutes) downtown.The house and the washroom were clean and we felt safe and welcomed there. "
259025,5007723,2013-06-07,5873200,Noor Adilah,"We had comfortable stay at Ali's place. The area is really easy especially for Muslim to find halal groceries & food. Thanks for sharing your stories and experience"
259025,5284277,2013-06-22,6675948,Matt,Was a unpleasant host. Would never stay again.
259025,5463005,2013-07-01,6711096,Gustavo,"Ali's an excellent host and the house is clean and tidy,  very close to the Metro station: perfect for a pleasant stay! Thanks for all!"
259025,5575588,2013-07-07,567910,Marion & Evan,"It has been a nice time at Alis place. Everything was very clean, tidied up and cosy. Ali was very friendly and answered every mail I wrote him very fast and helpful. I would stay there again, but only together with somebody, because it's a kind of suburb, where are more men then women on the street and I felt kind of watched, especially at night. Probably it's only my opinion and I'm to sensitive, because nobody of the other persons who wrote here felt like that... "
259025,5773044,2013-07-15,7355659,Alexandra,"We came to Sweden as a couple for a three-day weekend. We visited Stockholm, it's really pretty. Ali is friendly and welcoming. It really helped us. The accommodation is well located for the metro. Thank you for your hospitality. Goodbye"
259025,5835234,2013-07-18,7191031,Fanny,"We had good days at Ali's place, he was very welcoming and helpfull, ready to discuss and to give us his good plans in Stockholm.The subway is very close to the house and the line is direct to the town, so it was perfect for us.We recommend Ali's home !"
259025,6101012,2013-07-30,5652023,Kerstin,"We stayed at Ali's house for 5 days and it was great.The breakfast was perfect and the house was clean and our room comfortable. It was the best decision to book the breakfast, because at Stockholm the food is very expensive.Ali answered every mail we wrote to him, perfect.We can only recommend Ali's house."
259025,6318332,2013-08-08,914874,Adam,"This is a great, very affordable place to stay in Stockholm. The owner, Ali, has bedrooms on two floors that he rents out. We only met Ali briefly as he was away on holiday himself for most of our stay but he went out of his way to make sure we had everything we need. We were travelling with our 13 month old daughter and he arranged for us to have a cot in our room, which was hugely appreciated!Guests are allowed to prepare their own breakfast in the kitchen, and also use the microwave. So if anyone wants somewhere they can do a lot of home cooking this might not be ideal. The house is situated within 5 minutes walking distance of Rinkeby T-bana station, when you can catch a train into the centre that takes around 15-20 minutes. There is a small convenience store opposite the house where you can buy a few essential items to makes lunches etc - Ali is happy for you to keep some items in the fridge or freezer.   "
259025,6403456,2013-08-11,4432560,Karin,"I stayed to Ali's house two nights. Unfortunately he wasn't at home that day, and there were an assistant. We arrived late, about at midnight, and we couldn't find the house. There was a girl that open us and she didn't know what to do and stayed al the time at the phone with the assistant, so it was a little annoying because it was raining and we were outside to wait. Apart from that the room was fine, the house was clean, it was like to be at home. I regret that Ali wasn't there, probably we wouldn't have that problems at the beginning. At the end my opinion isn't bad, if you need to stay in Stockholm a couple of days it's good! "
259025,6839448,2013-08-26,3821469,Lennart,"At first we want to thank that we have so spontaneously get a room in Ali's house.The house was very clean and tidy. The room was big enough for us and equipped with fresh towels.We were a little disappointed about the fact that we were not allowed to use the kitchen for cooking.Thanks for the host...Ali was not there during our stay but a friend of him was there to welcome us and check if we needed everything. "
259025,7127750,2013-09-07,3945457,Max,The apparment is indeed a bit off the center but totally manageable with the travel post recomended in the description. The room is spacious and everything is very tidy. Ali was a nice host and was very supportive.
259025,8053741,2013-10-14,4695225,Yiran,"Ali is a kind hearted person. The house is warm and quiet but a little bit far away from the center. If you choose to leave here, it is highly recommended buy a 24 hours ticket. Please ask the ticket office about the address when you get off the subway to void missing."
259025,9155406,2013-12-09,6984583,Koen,"Ali was an excellent host, always open for a friendly chat. The room was fine too. I particularly appreciated Ali's quick response to whatever query I had, booking Ali's place was easy and fast. His place is somewhat remote from the center of Stockholm but easily reachable by metro. It is a really good option as prices are particularly high in the city center.  "
259025,10348406,2014-02-15,11133772,Smz,"I had a great time in Ali flat . He is a kind , friendly and has good hospitality . Bus stop was so close and undergrad was maybe 5 min walk . Thank you Ali and hope to see you again "
259025,12842761,2014-05-12,4481069,KwangSoon,"Ali's house is super clean, he welcomed us. The district is different than central Stockholm touristic place, you can stay in residential district. But if you like alcohol, it is not good idea to bring in home, pork as well. If u want to stay in a place calm, friendly but not too much, staying Ali's home would be good idea."
259025,15161970,2014-07-03,14805235,Wayne,Ali's apt. Is clean and comfortable. He went out of his way to meet us at t-bana station (a 5 min walk from his apt) when we arrived. We didn't really see him much because we were gone most of the time. It's about 15 min to the city center on the train. 
259025,15706171,2014-07-14,15469486,Lena,"We had a comfortable short stay, everything was clean, the house was spacious, Ali is really friendly. Everything is really organized-you can notice that he has hosted a lot of guests and that his place is a good option to stay. And if you plan ahead, it's no trouble that you aren't allowed to use the stove, but there's a microwave. And everything else in the kitchen can be used as well. "
259025,18597561,2014-08-28,20386635,Rafael,"Ali was very nice to us. His house is very clean and all in order. Our room was very comfortable, bright and large enough for the two of us.The location was what we were looking for, close to bus stop, short walking distance to metro station and a convenient store across from the house. He sent us a message before check in giving us clear directions how to come to his house and he even suggested to buy the 7 day transportation card which we enjoyed (even though we only stayed 4 nights) but it was cheaper and we could hope in hop off in trams, buses, trains and even some boats. It was really worth!Overall we had a very nice stay there and it was nice to be in a very clean and cute house.Thanks Ali.Rafael and Cecilia."
259025,31413151,2015-05-04,21701675,Tandy,"Didn't have much interaction with Ali, but he did welcome us on short notice and for that we are grateful. He even offered to drive us to get food since we arrived late. As for location, it is 30 minutes from the central station, further than I expected, but the metro station is a short walk away. Something to note is that it is located in the suburbs, so don't expect a lively neighborhood atmosphere. One thing that did confuse me though was the hefty cleaning fee I was charged, despite the fact that we were required to clean on the day of our departure. All in all, Ali's place served its purpose fine, but I would seek accommodation elsewhere next time I'm in Stockholm. "
259025,32557881,2015-05-19,31645626,Snehadri,"Ali is a very gracious host and we felt welcome at his place. He was nice enough to arrange breakfast on a short notice and also arranged a taxi for us when we needed it.The house was easy to find. The room is perfect for three people and the beds are really comfortable. The house is very well maintained and cleanliness is emphasized. The neighbourhood is quiet and a 5-minute walk from the metro station. The area is easily accessible by public transport, being around 20 minutes away from central Stockholm by metro. I am glad I chose Ali's place for our stay and I would choose it again."
259025,33415451,2015-05-27,29523083,Julie,Great stay. There were many other rooms for other visitors as well in the place. A little far from the main area but it's right next to the metro station and a bus station so it wasn't a big deal. Ali was super accomodations considering how my friend and I made this listing last minute.
259025,35312080,2015-06-17,16089142,Jansen,"Dirty room,  insufficient large room for such price. I will never repeat"
259025,53317655,2015-11-08,32818484,Sakshi,The house is very clean and well maintained. Ali helped us with all kinds of information required about/ in Stockholm.
259722,1078008,2012-04-03,881441,Matthew,"Marcelo is a very nice and easy going guy. The room is good, and was everything I needed. There is also a major shopping centre and train station just a short walk away from the apartment. All in all I think it's a nice place to stay."
259722,1221733,2012-05-03,1501340,Andrea,"Half of the room's walls are glass windows, both looking outside of the building and in the living room. These glass walls are covered with some tents, that's the privacy level the room enables. The real problem is actually having good sleep, as sun rises very early in the morning. Also I have been awaken by the  host, coming in at late night or couldn't fall asleep if somebody was watching tv or talking or cooking in the living room: the glass walls won't provide isolation either from light and sound. In one month I seldom awaken later than 6 am: plane mask is a must eventually bring earplugs.The room is packed with kids stuff and the guest's cupboard is in the living room, in the room there is a narrow table and a kid's stool. I don't recommend this, especially if you plan to stay more than few days or if you are coming here to work."
259722,1600824,2012-07-01,2124234,Romain,"Marcelo is the best hote of the world !Very simpatic polite and available.i have enjoy my travel of 2 months in marcelo's house !You can choose marcelo without problems !"

259722,2454577,2012-09-30,1001904,Anastasios,"Marcelo is very friendly and hospitable. He even allowed me to have an ethernet cable running through his living room so i could have internet access. The park right behind the room is just amazing. You can take walk trails through the woods and pick up berries. The room is relatively small but it was just what i needed for that small period of time. Thanks Marcelo!"
259722,4809516,2013-05-27,6034540,Sudhir,"I like  stay in marcelo house. he is friendly and  he make sure that you are comfortable in his house. he take cares everything which makes you live with your comfort. it was a nice experience and I would like to stay in his house. thanks for kind gesture shown during my stay.

259722,18989359,2014-09-04,17169512,Martin,"Location is superb with this ground floor flat linked to a small park which leads direct into the core of the science park. Down the road also within minutes is the transportation and shopping hub while also nearby the other way is the local train going out to the airport which may also be reached via the bus 179 right outside the building!The room itself is very cozy & light linked to a neat outdoor terrace.Amenities in the kitchen, bathroom & living room is very modern, well working & adequate while however for persons not used to sharing a flat with 2 other space & privacy may be a bit crammed/limited at times while very friendly & open minded :)Thank you for a great hosting Marcelo."
259722,24652386,2015-01-01,19826565,Vishal,"It was a great experience. The bed was comfy and the room has its privacy maintained after closing the door. I never had any problem while I stayed there. I was given separate cupboard, freeze shelf, towels and bed. The owner is the nicest person you ever can meet. You will feel like home away from home. The vicinity of T-banna and shops made the whole experience better. "
259722,29920847,2015-04-14,9706291,Harald,"During the first month of my work in Stockholm I stayed at Marcelo's apartment. The apartment/room is equipped with everything you need to have a convenient stay.  Marcelo is a open-minded and attentive host. I can highly recommend him and his place. Thanks again for hosting me :)"
259722,32116180,2015-05-14,28517851,James,"Marcelo is a fantastic host. He is very welcoming and generous. His apartment is very clean and organized. The bedroom I stayed in is comfortable and private, which is very important to me. His apartment is located close to a metro station (a 5-8 minute walk) and it only takes about 15 minutes or so to take the train into city center. I was very pleased with how accessible everything was. I highly recommend anyone stay here."
259722,104012100,2016-09-25,94340937,Sridharan,"Its been very happy stayed at Marcelo location. Cant expect more than that, room was very clean and neat. Marcelo was very helpful and he guide you if you need any assistance. "
259722,124650088,2017-01-02,31426455,Terry,I rented this location for a month but only stayed two weeks due to travelling but it was a good experience. The area is very quiet and close to the mall and metro station.
259722,143982508,2017-04-14,64937643,Heikki,"I stayed here for 2 months. My stay was better than expected. Communication with Marcelo is easy. Before I came I was worries that room would be cold because it is mostly windows but I was wrong. Room was nicely warm even though there was snow outside. Marcelo kept apartment really clean. Location is superb - only few minutes walk to metro station, buss station and nearest shopping center. I can highly recommend. Compared to other listings in Stockholm this was good quality for the money."
259722,274416587,2018-06-09,37780218,Pinak,"It's a beautiful place in laps of nature. It's nearby to Kista Galleria and just opposite to Kista Park. So it's an ideal place if you love peace and nature. Metro station, restraunts, pubs... Everything is nearby. The apartment is beautiful and equipped with all necessary amenities. I enjoyed my stay and recommend each and everyone to check this place if living in Kista."
259722,322939380,2018-09-14,201262119,Sinan,"Marcelo is a wonderful host. He is very professional with allocating the space you need for your groceries, laundry, trash, etc. and labeling them. It makes you feel very comfortable. The room isn't big but's it's perfectly reasonable for a single tennant. I's right as pictured, with a wardrobe and studying table. The lighting is very good, many different lamps and the room gets good amount of sunlight. Since it's ground level it's easy to access. It's located very good as well, one bus stop or 6 minutes walk from Kinsta centrum, where there's subway and all the stuff you need; great shopping center. From there you can go to city center or anywhere else you want thrpugh public transport. There's also a park nearby the house. Good location, great host, perfectly clean and tidy house... Definitely recommended."
259722,409302816,2019-02-07,230625211,Stefanie,"Marcelo is a very friendly and helpful host. The room was clean and I felt at home there. The location is great, near public transport and a shopping center."
259722,452446107,2019-05-13,240491866,Surendra,Marcelo's place is very adjacent to Kista park and very near to Galleria. The house is sparkling clean. Marcelo is very nice person and we had very nice discussions (whenever we had time). Will definitely stay at his place when I visit Kista again.
274876,1338962,2012-05-24,1613786,Claire,"The apartment was beautiful and so comfortable to stay in.  The neighborhood is great and our son loved all the parks that were close by.  Emma meet us when we arrived and suggested a bunch of restaurants, as well as places to go.  We had a great time!"
274876,1990783,2012-08-15,2089407,Sergey,"We have lived in Emma's apartment for almost a week and enjoyed our being in Stockholm immensely!  Her apartment is situated very conveniently in a good area, close to bus stops and downtown. Emma gave us a lot of useful information for tourists, was very sociable and friendly! Her apartment is very spacious, light and comfortable. It is a perfect place for a family rest!"
274876,2063320,2012-08-22,2578353,Dawn,"Very comfortable apartment in a convenient and hip area.  Quiet, but a short walk to exciting nightlife (according to my husband).  Emma was very friendly and helpful, too.  We loved it so much, didn't want to go home..."
274876,2121607,2012-08-28,2383719,Liv,"Emma's apartment was perfect for our family of five adults to stay for five nights.  The apartment was light, bright and airy.  It had a nice renovated and fresh feeling with a lovely outlook to a large central garden.  There was even wifi!The location was great, lots of cafes and boutiques in the area; it was only a short bus (#2) into the city or a 45 minute walk. Emma was a wonderful host even going to the trouble of buying a breakfast foods, milk and juice for our stay before she left.She was available to answer any questions and we can't think of anything that was missing.Thank you Emma"
274876,2307243,2012-09-17,2682604,Shaun,"We loved Staying at Emma's place in Stockholm. Emma herself was very friendly, and the apartment is wonderful. The place is stylish, spacious, and located in one of those neighborhoods that's nice and quiet but also just a short walk away from the more exciting parts of town. I really can't think of a single negative thing about our stay. Highly recommended!"
274876,4291622,2013-04-25,5343420,Murray,We stayed at Emma's apartment for four nights on April 2013.The apartment is clean and spacious and suited our needs perfectly.The area is great and there is many public transport options. Communication with Emma was easy and prompt. I would recommend Emma and her apartment to anyone.
274876,4783236,2013-05-26,4761840,James,"We couldn't have enjoyed staying at Emma's lovely pad more. It's a great space to hang out in and relax, spotlessly clean, comfortable and with all mod cons. It's a great location, 10 mins walk to downtown Sodermalm but also quiet enough that you get peace and quiet. Emma herself was so helpful and welcoming, being really flexible about arrival times and giving us hints and tips before she departed to make our stay a great one. Stockholm is a beautiful and friendly city, with loads to do; we could have stayed longer than our 4 days. All in all a great experience - as a first time Air BnBer, I'll do it again, and would wholeheartedly recommend Emma's lovely flat for a stay in Stockholm. "
274876,5456675,2013-07-01,5817475,Ashley,"Emma's place is wonderful and convenient by bus to the city center.  Her father met us to let us into the apartment and he was a wealth of information about Stockholm, both its history as well as recommendations what to do during our stay.  Also the elevator was wondering being that I was 7.5 months pregnant at the time.  The building is quite and with a great courtyard.    "
274876,5555266,2013-07-06,2308467,Maria,"Nice apartment that was very useful for our family of 4. Great kitchen and a very friendly 'help yourself' note on the fridge! Enjoyed our 4 day stay and very much enjoyed the space. Emma, even though she was on vacation was responsive to emails. Very helpful."
274876,5961766,2013-07-24,5433876,Meri,We (=four adults and two small children) spent a week at Emma's place in July 2013 and enjoyed very much our stay in this nicely decorated flat. It is situated in a calm area close to bus stops and within a short walking distance from the old town. As a Mom of a three-year-old I also appreciated a great deal the many toys that we could borrow in the lovely yard - this meant that we could also spend time in a warm weather outside in the inner yard while our son was playing...Plenty of restaurants nearby (you can even have some take out food from the Pizzeria just 100m away or Indian/Thai...). Emma as a host was very helpful and kind so we would highly recommend her flat to all those who wish to spend some time in Stockholm and discover this beautiful city from another perspective and another neighborhood than the ones where many of the hotels are located. Thanks Emma!  
274876,6666429,2013-08-20,7650082,Christos,"Our stay  at EMMA's flat was our  first experience using AIRBNB site. What we have experienced from the first moment that we met  EMMA and throughout the duration of our stay in this flat was wonderful. A real Lady, with a very warm reception, in a very beautiful, clean, with very nice decoration, modern and comfortable for our family of five persons, home. Very quiet building, in an ideal neighborhood, near to the GAMLA STAN, with very good transportation and with the most beautiful, modern and youthful bar-restaurants of STOCKHOLM. Our holidays in this city will be unforgettable and the main reason for this is that the choice of the flat was the best we could have done. For anyone who wants to start and finish his vacation in beautiful STOCKHOLM I recommend it unreservedly. We hope in the future that our choices on AIRBNB wil be so good.     VALUE FOR MONEY 10."
274876,6750602,2013-08-24,5797914,Liam,"My wife, daughter and I just finished a stay @ Emma's.  What a great place from which to see Stockholm!!!  A truly lovely flat and a wonderful host - we couldn't have hope for more.The flat is great - well situated in the coolest part of Stockholm - a genuine home away from home.  Emma was a lovely and really welcoming host.  Accessible.  Nice.  Full of good counsel.The flat is bright and airy and very well appointed.  Near by is food, and shopping and the easiest of access to one of the coolest cities in Europe.  We could have just moved in and stayed...If you are thinking of a visit to Stockholm - rent this flat!!!"
274876,6936274,2013-08-31,7358999,Colin,"Emma's place was a perfect choice for our visit to Stockholm. The apartment is well located and easy to find, close to good bars and restaurants, shops and public transport - but with the Old Town and local attractions only a few minutes easy and safe walk away, you'll probably not need it. The home is well furnished, stylish and clean with a great feel to it. There is a lovely balcony to enjoy the sunshine and view - no need for a clock, you can read the time on the Church tower! We all enjoyed our stay and hope we can stay there again before too long. Thoroughly recommend!"

274876,16197083,2014-07-23,12759127,Susanna,Emma's place was the perfect base for a girls weekend in Stockholm. The apartment was exactly the way it looks in the pictures and was very homey and welcoming. The location is central enough that we could walk almost everywhere but the neighbourhood was also quiet enough that we could relax at home in peace. I will definitely be recomending it to others!
274876,18463374,2014-08-27,5416866,Christophe,"We stayed 4 nights at Emma's place and we loved it very much. Emma was very helpfull and gave us lots of info about Stockholm and about the nighbourhood. The appartment was as it is advertised. We feld home the minute we stapped into the appartement.Busstops are around the corner but we did almost everything by food because nothing is far away.We would recommend Emma's place!"
274876,19025328,2014-09-05,15822263,Amy,Emma's apartment worked perfectly for our 8 day stay in Stockholm.  The apartment was centrally located and close to several bus lines into the city and within walking distance of many restaurants and 2 grocery stores.  Emma left everything we could need for the week and was readily available to respond to questions.  My 4 yr old as well as my 8 yr old niece traveled with us and there was a really nice park about 3 blocks away that they loved.  
274876,23503552,2014-12-02,4621036,Will,"Emma's place was fantastic.  Close to shops/bars/restaurants, but far enough to have peace and quiet when at home.  She was incredibly helpful from the very moment we touched down (with directions to get to her apartment with multiple options) to waiting for us in the apartment upon arrival to give us advice on all things Stockholm in person.  By FAR the most hospitable AirBnB host I have come across - I would highly recommend Emma's place to anyone else that comes to Stockholm. "

We all appreciated her extra effort to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Her apartment is beautiful, and was the perfect place for the four of us to enjoy our stay in Stockholm. We were there for 6 nights, and loved the neighborhood. The bus line stops right in front of the apartment, and the subway is a short walk. Sodermalm was a fun neighborhood, with lots of restaurants and coffee houses. Emma's apartment is located in a very quiet area, but only about 5 minutes from lots of restaurants and bars. I would love to stay here again. Everything was clean and fresh."

It was relatively easy to get to with very frequent bus service nearby. We appreciated the fun decor of the apartment and the nice little touches like the balcony overlooking the courtyard, extra charging cords for the electronics, and cool furniture. This would be an ideal place for a couple, a small group, or a family.Emma was a great host. She took the time to meet us in person and give suggestions on what to see in Stockholm. She was very responsive with inquiries that we had during our stay. I would highly recommend this place!"

The apartment has plenty of space; didn't feel crammed with 4 of us. It was also clean, comfortable and super cute. The neighborhood is perfect; quiet, yet plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Not touristy at all, which we were hoping to avoid. Favorite restaurants were Gossip, Greasy Spoon and Urban Deli. All in all, awesome experience and I would stay again in a heartbeat."

I would recommend this apartment to anyone with a family.  Also the location is great for adults and children. The balcony and beds make the place cozy. Emma was very accommodating from the beginning.  She let us arrive later after we had agreed upon a time and stay later.  She laid out everything necessary for our family, quickly explained how things worked in the apartment, and left us to discover on our own.   I hope to return!"
274876,84811991,2016-07-09,476657,Jason,Our stay was excellent. The apartment was comfortable and easy and Emma was supportive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Stockholm.
274876,92595632,2016-08-09,13766845,Pascal,"It was a pleasure staying at Emma's apartment in Sodermalm, the nicest borough to stay for visiting Stockholm. The apartment is very comfortable for a family of 5 or 6. It's cosy sitting outside on the balcony and right around the corner there are shops, a supermarket and good restaurants. It's only 15 minutes walking to the old city, but the City Bike and bus stop are only a few hundred meters away. Emma is very helpful and welcoming, even at 11 p.m. when you arrive from a late flight."
274876,98060567,2016-08-29,74200296,Bertrand,"Exceptional place. Emma's appartment is very well designed and decorated. A lot of charm. We had a great time ?family of 5 for 5 daysEmma is very good hostHighly recommended "

274876,123415481,2016-12-29,27886972,Pascale,"Perfect!Emma is very helpful: she gave us all the explanations we needed before the trip and when arriving.Very nice apartment, warm and cosy.  We are a family of 5 persons, and it was just fine. Very good location: quiet area but close to lots of restaurants.  Also very close from a store (open 7:00-22:00 - very convenient).Great welcome from Emma (sweets, tea and coffee for the breakfast).That's the place where we want to be if we go to Stockholm again!Thank you Emma for sharing your lovely home!"
274876,155850128,2017-05-29,25759765,Jorge,"Emma has been a real super host, the best one we had so far in Airbnb. She was waiting for us at the apartment when we arrived and gave us good tips to move around. Before we arrived and during our stay, Emma was very responsive to our emails, answering within minutes if not seconds. Amazing! The apartment is located in a very nice area. It has a perfect size and orientation. You will fall in love with its small terrace from where to enjoy the sun in the morning while having a cup of coffee. The apartment was very clean and Emma bought some welcome food for us. I strongly recommend this place to everyone looking for a great place to stay to visit the beautiful city of Stockholm."
274876,157922285,2017-06-05,44494137,Nathalie,"Emma is an amazing, reliable host that knows how to make u feel at home away from home. Her apartment is cozy, quiet, very well located in a great area of the city. Can really recommend this place!"

274876,177628503,2017-08-03,122523765,Arnaud,"Horrible place, very unpleasant host"
274876,179996943,2017-08-09,70572775,Jonathan,"Lovely, clean apartment in great, residential neighborhood of happening Sodermalm. We were traveling with our 4 children, so the space was just a wee bit tight - but not my much. Emma was very responsive and accommodating and seemed happy to be sharing her home (she even let us eat her ice cream!). Was an excellent location for a family - nearby parks, easy walks, QUIET at night. Bus to ferry + walking to Djurgarden was about 20-30 minutes. Not a problem for us and we quite enjoyed the walks. Two quirks to know about: no coffee machine (at least that we were able to find - but great cafes very close by!), and no drawer or closet space for your clothes -  (this is still Emma's home so all of her family's items in place). Would certainly return."
274876,181749466,2017-08-13,84772658,Stefan,"Emma is een vriendelijke gastvrouw en heeft ons bij aankomst goede tips gegeven over de omgeving. Het mooie appartement bevind zich in een rustige nette wijk, maar toch op enkele minuten lopen afstand van winkelcentra, musea en knooppunten voor het openbaar vervoer. We hadden een Stockholm pass gekocht waarmee we toegang hadden tot 60 bezienswaardigheden, en de hop-on-hop-off boot, die op 10 minuten loopafstand van het appartement een stopplaats heeft."
274876,184346595,2017-08-19,92308383,Susan,"Beautiful, tidy, very clean apartment, well equiped. Perfect location. We were a family of 5 who had plenty of space. Playgrounds, coffee, supermarkets, beer! all close by. Trendy area. Plenty of running routes. Fantastic host."
274876,190789531,2017-09-05,53860585,Beverly,Emma was a gracious host and very accommodating. Communication was very quick and easy.  Her home is well furnished and our family of 4 adults and 2 children ages 2 and 4 enjoyed staying there.  The neighborhood is great with cafes and restaurants and walking distance to many stores.  We would definitely stay there again and thank Emma for making our stay in Stockholm and enjoyable one!
274876,199141279,2017-10-01,11176270,Camilla,"Emma is an excellent host and her apartment is beautiful, has a lot of space and is clean.

Her apartment was within walking distance of many amazing restaurants and boutique shops, along with various parks.  We traveled with four kids, and  were able to explore the immediate neighborhood and venture to the more touristy areas (Gamla Stan, Djurgarden) with ease.  Emma was immediately responsive to any question or request, and made sure we were perfectly set up for our stay.  Her apartment was exceptionally clean and very comfortable for our family of six.  Located on the fourth floor, but with an elevator so easy to access."
274876,263528597,2018-05-12,84578012,Margaret,"What a find!Both Emma and her lovely flat exceeded expectations!The flat is clean, bright, and well stocked and maintained!And Emma helped us with navigating her neighborhood and city of StockholmAll her food recommendations we're spot on!Love the location, lots of restaurants and shops.Highly recommend Emma and her flat!"

We had a fantastic time, the place is exactly as described, in a lovely and safe area of town. Emma even had a cot and a highchair for us and in the yard of the building is a nice little area with some toys where the kids could play safely. The apartment is well equipped and there was plenty of space for all of us. We had our camper van with us and we could park it directly outside the building and parking fees were not too high given it was in a city. The bus stop was just about 100 metres down the road and a supermarket and Systembolaget in walking distance nearby, as well as various restaurants, bars and a lovely park with playground. We walked to most places during our stay, the location is great for exploring Stockholm."

Her place is clean and stylish.  It's located in a nice neighbourhood, that's close to many different bus stops that can easily get you to most places you need to go in Stockholm within 15 minutes.  Emma made sure my toddler was taken care of and provided a pack and play and high chair for him.  She was also very prompt when we had questions.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and would stay there again if we ever find ourselves in Stockholm."

Flexible, willing to help me out with anything (when I suggested I might get lost, they gave me one of their cell phones, and I could use a card for public transport in Stockholm). They made me feel very welcome and served excellent , fresh(not too spicy!!) Indian food and told about their lives and experiences. The surroundings of Akalla are surpringely beautiful, fields, forests, farm, all of it was near, as was the subway to Stockholm itself."
283446,1635834,2012-07-05,2382760,The Hung,"We had a wonderful stay with Vidhatri family during our travel to Stockholm. Their apartment is large and clean and looks exactly the same pictures shown in the web. The apartment is located in a safe and quite area, and from their place you just need around 20 minute to reach central Stockholm by metro and easily to reach Arlanda airport using SL tickets. Therefore, I strongly recommend Vidhatri apt for your upcoming visit to Stockholm."

The location is great too, because it's like one minute walking from the metro station, and from there it's really quick to get to the main attractions in Stockholm. Food was really good too.It was my first Airbnb experience, and it was not less than an excellent one. I am really glad I stayed at Comfort Stay @ Stockholm - Kista IT."

283446,2083468,2012-08-24,3071594,Teodora,"I've moved to Stockholm to study a master programme at the University. It is the first time I left home for such a long time and I thought it will be really hard for me to be far from the ones I care for, but Vidhatri made it really easy for me. She is just the perfect host ever! At her place I felt like being at home. She is so kind and it's a pleasure to stay and have a nice conversation at dinner or during the day at a cup of coffee. I really don't have to say that she is a great cook, because you will discover if you will chose this apartment. ( which it's really clean, cosy and only one minute away from the subway station ). If you need a place to stay in Stockholm I highly recommend Vidhatri's place."

They came all the way to the port to pick me up when I got to Stockholm, and escorted me all the way to the airport when I had to leave. They let me use their bus/subway pass at a discounted price, and they cooked delicious and authentic Indian meals for me. The bed was super comfortable... (The first thing I did when I got to their home was take a nap.) They treated me like family, and they even planned out a schedule for me with a list of the places I should visit during my short stay in Stockholm.

The couple is very sweet and helpful, helped me with all the bus numbers, routes and timings. Vidhatri ji made me the indian stuffed bread in breakfast, which was just delicious as any of the best indian restaurant. It was most comfortable stay. Even when I had to catch the bus at 2 am , Bala ji helped me finding the bus stop at that awkward time, which is so nice of him. I will always like to stay with tis family in a heartbeat whenever I will come to Stockholm visit. :)"

283446,6843318,2013-08-27,1865587,Bo,"I had a wonderful stay at Vidhatri and Bala's place. It was in a quiet location just a minute's walk from the metro station (2 minutes if you're slow). A 20 minute ride to center city, which was always the perfect length of time for me to plan out my day. And if you like Indian food, which I do, you're in for a treat - amazing food and great conversation as well! You'll never be hungry. I often had to skip lunch since I ate so much for breakfast, which was perfect since it allowed me more time to check out places in Stockholm. Most importantly of all, Vidhatri and Bala are just good people who really go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I would definitely recommend staying at their place, when it's available. Last but not least, if you enjoying running, there's hundreds of acres (if not thousands) of soft surface paths in a countryside setting right behind their place. I ran 12-18 kilometers a day when I was there and there always seemed to be new trails I haven't tested before. Always got the day started on the right footing!"
283446,6927020,2013-08-30,201651,Lucie,We stayed two nights at vidha's place. A cozy place to stay! She is an amazing cook and such a kind person. Vidha and her husband were very helpful and gave us a lot of advices. 
283446,19031675,2014-09-05,17836172,Jennifer,"Vidhatri was a great host and her family were all very welcoming and helpful. The room was nice, clean and big, and the location is convenient - only two minutes on foot to the underground station and then a direct twenty minute train to the centre. Breakfast was included in the stay, which is a wonderful convenience. Even better, they were happy to cater to my dietary requirements and made the most delicious vegan breakfasts. A very accommodating family, we would definitely stay again. "
283446,19152107,2014-09-07,20139827,Svea,"A good choice for a stopover before heading to the airport. Easy transport connections. Nice open air walkways which are welcome before heading into long flights. Shops and restaurants conveniently a few steps away. Close to metro which has lifts if you have luggage. Neat, clean and tidy. Nice extra touch was the offer of use of a secure wifi connection. The area is a busy residential one so there may be some people noise - it didn't bother me but I am pretty travel robust."
283446,19307617,2014-09-09,9831185,Richard,"Conveniently situated very close to a metro station and the room was exactly what I was looking for, very clean and fast wi-fi. Vida and Bala were were available to answer any questions and even woke up very early in the morning to offer breakfast before I left for the airport.

My stay with the family was very memorable - convenience (few metres to T-bana, supermarket and variety of shops), homely stay and authentic freshly cooked Indian meals. Interaction with all family members was interesting and I already miss them. "
283446,23200678,2014-11-24,21414822,Tomer,As soon as I got to the apartment Vidharti welcome me so nicely and introduce me to her family. They invited me to home made lunch and were so polite to me. They gave the filing of been at home. They helped me with things which I had to sattle. They gave me the privacy and comfort that I like. The room is big and very comfortable with wide double bed. At night they invited me to a pizza and tea and in the morning they took care for my breakfast.  I really felt at home with their home hospitality.  Definitely a place that I will come back again. Very recommend
283446,23256168,2014-11-26,16001580,Veera Prasad,"I had a nice stay here, it was like homely living. Both the couple Vidhi and Bala received me as if own family member. Though my stay here was shortened by a day, I had very good time staying with lovely family. The food was really tasty. "
283446,23389626,2014-11-30,3031797,Nirit,"I came to Stockholm just for 20 hours on my layover from NY to Tel Aviv. My stay with Vidhatri and family was just perfect. The room was spotlessly clean and so was the bathroom, and they invited me for deliciious Indian dinner. We chatted at the living room and I heard from them about their interesting experience of living in Sweden. Absolutely lovely couple with an upbeat, radiationg personalities. Bana called a taxi cab for me and got up with me at 4:30am to prepare sweet tea for me and wait with me for the cab downstairs. That was so kind of him. My stay in Stockholm was absolutely perfect thanks to Vidharti and Bana. "
283446,25770844,2015-01-25,18213673,Aleksandr,very nice people. in the morning made breakfast and even gave sandwiches away for the road. next time stop again.

283446,31155842,2015-05-02,119843,Lorenzo,"Vidhatri and her family are just wonderful.  She's very caring host, Also she prepare food on a daily bases better then a gourmet chef. The room is very large and  bright can accomodate 2 easily . Takes about 15 min by underground from central station. I would choose this accommodation again? Definitely!!!  Many thanks again."
283446,32790886,2015-05-21,31053682,Shruthi,"I have done a best choice for my CEO for her Sweden visit.It was definitely home away from home.It was a fruitful trip to Sweden.  The hospitality is Best.Thanks"
283446,32901459,2015-05-23,30281463,Narendra,"A nice welcome from Vidharti where one can find a home away from home. Vidharti is very active in any type of response either message or sms or phone call and you can get any possible help from her. I hope one can enjoy the stay with nice family.What is described here one can find the same there. You will surely feel self as a part of family. If possible and get a chance don't miss the enjoyment of traditional food."
283446,33418103,2015-05-27,8705511,Sagar,Vidhi and her husband were very friendly and helpful. They gave us good recommendations on places to visit in Stockholm and we very much appreciated the home cooked meals. Their home is a little outside the main city (about 30 min by train) but the train station is 2 min away and trains are fairly frequent. We would recommend their place for future travelers. 
283446,34169450,2015-06-05,33743724,Michele,"The room is cozy with a nice view of the park. The apartment has two bedrooms, a livingroom, a kitchen, and one shared bathroom. You really could not ask for a better location, easy access to the metro and grocery store coupled with the best nature you could imagine just a short walk away with cows, horses, pigs, goats, hills, and beautiful pastures. But thats not even the main reason I would advise staying at this location. Vidhatri and her family are very amazing people. They were very kind to us throughout our entire stay and extremely helpful when it came to providing directios and advice. They also make very delicious indian food which was always a plus. If you do not like eating vegetarian or do not enjoy exploring other cultures then this may not be the place for you. We however are very fond of learning and experiencimg different cultures so this was great for us. Additionally, everyone in this family seemed to wake up early in the morning, which would make sense since the sun rises at 4 am in Sweden. So it helps if you also prefer to rise early in the morning. Overall we really enjoyed staying in Sweden and being emersed in nature which this location provides."
283446,34373008,2015-06-07,18716609,Raphael,"Thanks a lot for this super good stay!Everything went well, the apartment was super clean and the room had anything you need, incl. fast WIFI connection.Bala is a pretty nice host and takes really care about the guests needs. Every morning, Bala prepared a fresh and delicious breakfast - thanks again!I really recommend this comfort stay, next to Akalla Metro station (15 minutes from T-Centralen Stockholm) - pretty easy to go there!"
283446,34745459,2015-06-11,7119932,Youxin,"Vidhi and her family were very welcoming and thoughtful hosts - giving me sightseeing tips, chatting about travels, inviting me to share meals, and even booking the laundry ahead of time for use. The room is as pictured. Their flat is very close to the metro stop and ~30 minutes away from city center. I had a great stay here and would come again! "
283446,35480408,2015-06-19,33711202,Harekrishna,"We feel like home, where the mother cares for everything. At the same time we enjoyed the trip very much with the help of Bala Sir who treated us as younger brothers.They have given full freedom of using all the facilities at the home.I have no more words to describe the Hospitality given by Bala Sir and Vidhatari Madam.Thanks You again. You people were beyond our imagination."
283446,36266257,2015-06-27,3202272,Barb,"I could not have asked for more considerate hosts than Vida trip and her family. Both she and her husband came by train and bus to the airport because the knew I was having some mobility problems and that was only the beginning. Vida try introduced me to South Indian cuisine, delicious.She accompanied  me to lovely gardens.Both her and her husband were so generous, in so many ways. Vida trip is a teacher and taught me a lot about Swedish customs. It was an absolutely wonderful experience living with Vida trip and the rest of her family.On the practical side, it is easy to get to theirhome which is in a wonderful area. The room is adequate and the bed very comfortable."
283446,37230139,2015-07-05,35031930,Chris,"Vidhatri and her family are incredibly friendly and treat you like family; the hospitality was amazing and the energy is full of mirth. You definitely will start your days in the mornings with a full stomach!  I have learned lots of Swedish culture and how to make South Indian food, and without staying at Vidhatri I believe I might not have had such an amazing experience in Stockholm. The location is VERY convenient! Only a three minute walk to the train station, and you can take it directly into the center of the city! The windows are huge and inviting in the kitchen area so you can have a morning stretch while looking at the stretches of nature before you.Overall: very pleasant! I believe it is the ideal place to stay during your visit to Stockholm.Thank you, Vidhatri! I will return again soon."
283446,38834296,2015-07-19,32131632,Saguna,"We felt completely at home staying with Vidhatri and Bala. Immediately on arrival we were welcomed with warm fresh Indian food.

Vidhatri's husband Bala came and greeted me at the metro station, which was great. The room was spacious and clean, and I received a very warm welcome (with cookies and tea). Additionally, Vidhatri was kind enough to cook me dinner on my first day of arriving. The breakfasts everyday were great - South Indian homecooked food all the way in Sweden. The entire family is friendly and very helpful. Overall, it was a great stay and I would recommend this airbnb to others visiting Stockholm."

Enjoyed the vegetarian breakfast and dinner with varied menu each day. Breakfast was even ready for me when I arrived in the morning. Vidhi took the trouble to prepare breakfast before my early morning departure. She and her husband are friendly and warm hosts who made me feel at home right away, and spent time to chat with me.

283446,154794137,2017-05-26,99237012,Jermaine,"Check in was great, Vidhatri was extra informative with instructions, pricing and logistics which was valuable. I was also given great instructions on places to eat. I was there for business and the football the stadium was only a few stops away on the train and the location of the train station was perfect. The apartment is also located next to a great park with animals and good for a walk or run. If you want to get to central Stockholm it is a distance that was the only negative but no fault of the hosts. The area was a little ghetto lots of young men hanging around and could be a little imposing if you are a female, again no fault of the hosts. Some good shops locally for food and bits and pieces. There is a pizza restaurant near by which is a football hub and good beer (no wifi) Hospitality was superb and it was great to taste some home made Indian breakfast. The bed could be more comfortable and more pillows provided but the room was great/tidy. The wifi was great too. "

299154,7757997,2013-10-01,3519258,Paul,"Daniel's apartment is in a great location and he was on hand to meet us at the property and talk us through the apartment and the area. In this regard he was very helpful and friendly. Note that the apartment is very small, which is fine, but there is nowhere (literally) to unpack clothes as the apartment is full of Daniel's own belongings. But this was a minor inconvenience at worst, and I would happily recommend Daniel's apartment to others. We chose not to use the balcony in the cold and rain, but I think that in warmer weather this feature would be a real boon. "
299154,7881665,2013-10-07,8459188,John,"Clean versatile apartment on the 3rd floor. Small kitchen, queen bed, and L sofa. Large flatscreen TV. Balcony. Two minute walk to train station, and in good area of Sodermalm, close to Gamla Stan."

The apartment had everything you could need and beds were very comfy. Perfect for 2 friends travelling together or a couple...3 people might find it a bit small if staying for longer than a couple of nights. All in all wouldn't hesitate to recommend Daniel's apartment if you're visiting Stockholm!"
299154,8985685,2013-11-30,9871368,Michael,Great small apartment in happening neighborhood. Daniel stayed to greet us even though our plane was 3 hours late. He has another house in Sweden so the place is private. He is a very thorough host. The couch/ bed works great for a second person

299154,11464706,2014-04-04,9522019,Chris,"What a wonderful time and fabulous place to stay Daniel was the perfect host and so accommodating. The beds were more comfortable than a Westin Heavenly Sleep, honestly (or maybe we were just too exhausted from a great day of the Palace, Nobel, Ikea.) Super location and perfect directions...and a fab hot shower. We would stay again and totally recommend."
299154,11712099,2014-04-13,6459898,Yuliana,"Apartment is located close to Gamla Stan. Near many restaurants, cafes, shops. Daniel was accommodating. And he has a capsule-coffee with a delicious coffee;) We spent 3 days in Stockholm. The best impressions. I recommend this apartment."
299154,12377320,2014-04-30,13913122,Thomas,Great stay at Daniel's place. Location was perfect to visit Stockholm and it has everything you could need and more. Neighborhood is alive and you'll find a lot of places to stop for shopping or having fika. Daniel gave us nice explanations when we arrived and we didn't required his help during the three days. Really good !
299154,12876347,2014-05-13,9318203,Jim,"My husband and I loved the location of Daniel's apartment in Sodermalm. It was cozy but had all of the essentials. We thoroughly enjoyed the balcony. The street traffic, mostly bicycles and foot traffic, was always interesting. Daniel's space heater made this a usable area in early May. Most sites we wanted to see were within walking distance or an easy ride on the subway, about 1 minute away. The water pressure was strong and there was never a shortage of hot water. On are arrival Daniel gave us very good information about the neighborhood, stores, restaurants etc. We were delighted to find a bottle of sparkling wine in the fridge to celebrate the first night of our delightful honeymoon in Stockholm.  The unit was priced right for the week and met our complete expectations. We would definitely recommend this unit and would happily return. "
299154,12967512,2014-05-16,893009,Chirag,A good neighbourhood with small but good rooms. A little small for a family of 4 but 2 people can comfortably stay. The neighbourhood quite good with slusen station a 2 minute walk.
299154,13079028,2014-05-19,6470198,Marjan,"De flexibiliteit van Daniel is groot. Onze vlucht had vertraging waardoor onze aankomst erg laat was.  Dankzij de betrouwbaarheid van Daniel was de ontvangst vlekkeloos.  Het appartement is volledig ingericht waarschijnlijk ook doordat Daniel zelf het appartement bewoont wanneer het niet verhuurt is. Qua locatie: perfect!  Midden in de relaxte Sodermalm, dichtbij metrostation Slussen en op loopafstand van Gamla Stan. "
299154,13584874,2014-05-31,7503765,Valerie,"This apartment is in the perfect location. Daniel was very very helpful and accommodating about our trip.  It was a little small for two people (not a romantic couple), but the location made up for the size!  It is walking distance to plenty of restaurants and even the old city (Gamla Stan).  A great place to stay! "
299154,13645330,2014-06-02,7275788,Steve,"Daniel was a very generous host. He met us and gave us plenty of information about the apartment and the neighborhood. While it is a small flat, for the two of us it was perfectly serviceable and its location made it a great choice. 5 minutes walk to the old city, 10 minutes walk to the Sofo district of bistros, cafes and night life. Public transport was within easy reach.  We spent one day wlaking around the old town and the northern area and then back to home without getting tired. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom quite large and the balcony was an excellent place to cool off. Certainly would recommend it to a couple visiting Stockholm."
299154,13847778,2014-06-06,3727512,Anita,"The apartment is perfect situated in the center of  the bohemic Stocholm. Close to restaurangs, pubs etc. The underground station is just around the corner. The apartment is well equiped and extra nice with a big flatscreen. Well working wi-fi . The host very nice and easy to communicate with. When I had problem to manage the  TV he help me quickly. I can recommend this apartment."
299154,14180009,2014-06-14,11967605,Jeff,I stayed here with two close friends and we found Daniel's apartment to be the perfect place to be in the middle of things in Sodermalm-day and night.  Daniel could not have done more for us and he proved to be responsive throughout the booking process and reliable at check-in.  An unreserved recommendation from us.  If you are in Stockholm you only need a place to lay your head for a few hours until you can get back out into the city and Daniels's place is perfect for that!
299154,14770078,2014-06-26,4897995,Tanya,"Daniel and his place were both wonderful!  The location was fantastic - right in the middle of everything, with easy access to all of the places we wanted to go.  The surrounding shops and cafes were also great fun.  Daniel was very responsive and welcoming.  The only downside was that we had to get on a plane and come back to the real world eventually."
299154,14899439,2014-06-29,5016480,Jennifer,Daniel's apartment is in a fantastic location.  It is right around the corner from a great street of restaurants and shops in Sodermalm.  It is also a very short walk (10 minutes) from Gamla Stan (old town).  Daniel was a great host.
299154,15399375,2014-07-08,15093692,Jacob Westy,"The apartment was as expected, cosy small and furnished in a good practical way. Very nice and personally. We met Daniel twice, when we arrived and later on when he very quickly came with a new coffemashine. Good machine and good coffee too. We appriciated the little balcony and the uppermadras for the sofabed. The road was more quiet than expected, only a few cars are passing. If it hasn't been for the good weather and the balcony the appartment is a little to small for 3 grown ups. Our grown up son (20) was very fond of the decor. Every thing works in the appartment. Daniel is a very reliable and pleasant host."

299154,19739811,2014-09-17,10891115,Morgen,Daniel was very communicative prior to arrival and really went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed.

His flat will be me first thought on my next visit to Stockholm.

299154,32360980,2015-05-17,2696494,Dan,"The apartment is really well arranged and spacious even for 4 grown ups. It has all the things you would need including a cozy balcony perfect for chilling late in the evening after a busy day.The location is perfect for walking around the most hip parts of town. It was actually the main reason for choosing it over everything else as, not only you save up money from the public transportation, but also are close to lots of pubs, cafes and restaurants.As for the host, Daniel was very friendly and flexible with the checkin/out times. Getting the keys and leaving the apartment was smooth. My friends and I had a great time here."
299154,32609274,2015-05-19,20295729,John,Daniels place was awesome.  Very close to public transportation and the located in the cool part of Stockholm.  The place was very clean and well appointed.  He was extremely helpful in squaring us away both at his place and with the location.  About a black away is a bar with live music and the best Mussels and cheeseburger I have ever had.  
299154,32732184,2015-05-20,33550378,Brian,Daniels house is cozy and excellently located. We had a wonderful time in Stockholm and this apartment was one of the main reasons! Daniel met us at the apartment and welcomed us warmly. We would definitely stay again!

299154,33065322,2015-05-25,3392814,Sandy,"This tiny apartment is the perfect place to visit and see Stockholm, the neighborhood is fantastic with the walking street just around the corner and only a 10 minute walk across the bridge to the old town.  Daniel was very welcoming and making contact with him went as smooth as it could be.   Although the apartment says it is for 4 people, and it will sleep four people fairly comfortably the apartment was so small that it was very difficult to find room for luggage for 3 people.  I would highly recommend this place for 1 or 2 people."
299154,33363317,2015-05-27,20853029,Shelsy,Daniel's apartment was at an amazing location and I only wish I could have stayed longer! The apartment is spacious and comfy! We didn't get to meet Daniel but he was super through and made sure we had a way in! 
299154,34060280,2015-06-04,30002588,Maria,"Daniel was out of town but kindly made arrangements with his friendly neighbor Rolf to help us get settled. Everything went smoothly, and the location close to the subway and old town could not have been better. It was a small studio, but one person on the sofa and one on the bed worked just fine. He left us lots of recommendations and guide books -- very helpful."
299154,34881672,2015-06-13,7118925,Sanden,"Daniel is the real deal. A nice guy with a nice flat. Small but cozy, right in the heart of the coolest part of Stockholm: this place is ideal. We enjoyed the flat and neighborhood and recommend it to everyone."
299154,35073753,2015-06-15,20559850,Domenick,"Great apartment in the perfect neighborhood. Daniel was a very accommodating host, which came in handy following multiple airline delays. The apartment was small, but perfect for two people. The balcony was clutch."
299154,35368634,2015-06-18,21263615,Kari,"The location of this apartment is excellent for exploring Stockholm. It is easy to find and has everything you need within walking distance - subway, shops, restaurants, and cafes. Daniel met us at the apartment, showed us around, and answered any questions we had. He was very kind and helpful. There were 4 of us (2 adults and 2 kids) and it was a tight fit for us and all of our luggage, but it worked perfectly for us. Access to Wifi was great and I appreciated all of Daniel's guide books and helpful information. We had everything we needed and enjoyed our stay. Before our stay, Daniel was always very fast at responding to any emails and texts."
299154,36267332,2015-06-27,29759452,Helene Ring,"We were so lucky to have Daniel's appartement be our first AirBnb experience; what a great start. Daniel was so fast at answering our request to stay in the apartment, our questions in advance and messages while we were in the apartment. Such a nice, funny and good guy.The apartment is brilliantly layed out and decorated. So cleverly done and bigger than I thought from the photo. Other then that it looks exactly as the photos. Clean and cosy made us feel at home right away. Real character. BIG nice TV and a threat to have Netflix :) Nice soft bed.The location is PERFECT. I twisted my ankle the week before we went, so it was so good to be able to quickly get back home for a little rest before going out again for more experiences. Lots of nice shops in the neighbourhood, very short to the subway/bus etc. and very good to have the opportunity to go outside on the balcony. We are all ready planning our next trip :) Maybe just before Christmas, I can imagine Gamla Stan must be such a wonderland then. Perfect place for romantic walks in the summer too. "
299154,37278722,2015-07-06,20195501,Dexter,"We stayed 4 persons in Daniels apartment, and it was a lovely experience.

Thanks Daniel, a lovely stay!"

There are lots of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity, but walking to Gamla Stan and even further to Norrmalm was quick and easy.  The only negative I have is that when we arrived, the bed was not made up for us.  Nothing is more of a downer than arriving on your vacation and finding out that you have to make the bed!  Maybe in the future that could be done in advance of the guest.  :)"
